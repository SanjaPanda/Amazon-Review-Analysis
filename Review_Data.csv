    Poor call quality - had to return
  
","









  
  
    
  Got these earphones after a long research. The online reviews focus mostly on the sound quality. These buds perform well in that department. Dual drivers deliver good and loud output. The case is made up of soft touch plastic. The magnetic buds snap in perfectly. No complaints on design and build quality.Where these fail miserably is the microphone department. I had to write this review so that others buy these with this point in mind. I could not find any detailed review on the call quality - for which I had to suffer. Calls sound muffled through these mics. The person on the other end always had complaints regarding the sound - in a quiet or noisy environment I was sounding really bad. I personally heard it by pairing it to someone else's phone - the microphones are truly miserable.Also would like to comment on the fit - they are okay but will not provide too much of passive noise cancellation.Also, what's the deal with free movie vouches for posting a review on Amazon? Are you kidding me crossbeats?Have returned the product.

  Music quality is Way better than the competitors - 4/5Call quality is decent enough  - 3/5  but could have been better as the mic sometimes sounds muffled to the other person.Noise cancellation is way good for this price.The case is very premium, green is far better than grey.the earpods are very light, they snug fit easily, I go to Gym wearing them and exercise whic includes running and they dont fall at all.

  Pathetic earpods. One side worked only if your head was tilted towards one side. As soon as you keep your head straight the right side stops working. It was so frustrating and utter waste of time. Returned it.Not worth the amount. If you are selling someone item worth 5k at least do a proper quality check.

  Ordinary sound, ordinary bass, ordinary fit. Everything is ordinary about these earphones. I purchased these after reading the good reviews, & after using them for around 15-20 min, I wondered what was wrong with the people giving good reviews. Definitely trust the bad reviews on these.

  Workout - No No.It falls off, tried with all 3 pairs of earbuds.Hence the one star because they market it as being perfect for working out.Calls - Even in extreme quiet, the other person will struggle to hear you. The mic is a big problem.Fit - Sticks out of your ear. Does not fit in like shown in pictures. It's clearly visible - almost looks like a mole.If your idea is to listento music, the sound is crisp and the bass is okay.The bluetooth auto connects which is good.Connects one earphone as well.All in all, not value for money. Wait for better options or buy other brands.(I passed the deadline to return the product so I'm stuck with it, but I use it to listen to music so alright.)

  When people praised the look of the earphones to the sky, I though they were kidding. These are really adorable ear pieces which pair amazingly quickly to your tab or phone using BT 5.0. The sound quality is stunning with the right levels of bass and treble. However, sometimes during calls.. I need to hold one ear piece near my mouth if I am not loud enough for the dual mics from the ear pieces to pick up my voice. So, it's not for low tone mushy calls .. hehe. Low latency means video viewing is without audio lag. I love it that they charge in their cute little case every time I put them there and are ready for my next listen. The case can easily fit in your pocket and is quite sturdy, so super portable. You will never run out of juice.At 4.5k, they offer grreat value for money. The case is also a type C fast charging unit but yet to try it. Use your own charger or power bank.

    Don't fall for the paid positive reviews
  
","









  
  
    
  First of all I would like to warn you that the positive reviews here are all paid reviews, the incentive being 3 months ganna subscription. As soon as you register the product for the warranty you start getting whatsapp messages and calls from a crossbeats customer representative number continuously asking you to send screenshot of positive review in exchange of 3 months gaana subscription.  They have this dedicated channel for pushing customers to give positive reviews but in case you face an issue there is no way you can directly talk to a customer representative to resolve it. You have to send a mail to support and wait for 48 hours for a reply, that too in first mail reply they will ask for invoice and other product details even though you're sending the mail from the same mail id in which the product is registered. In the second mail they will ask you to restart the bud and check if it resolves the issue and in the third mail ask you to record a video of the problem and send them. I am facing audio connectivity issue, still they asked me to send a video, don't know how can I record in video. So on average it is almost a week till you get actual response for your problem. Now whether it will actually help you in another issue.I was having connectivity issue for which the audio output from the right bud is getting disrupted very frequently. It is for split second only but every few seconds it is repeating like this which is very irritating. And the response which I finally got after one week is ""This is standard across all Bluetooth powered devices."". I was told it is because of my WiFi that the bluetooth connection is getting disrupted and it is very normal. But when I replied that I have been using a bluetooth earphone and bluetooth speaker of other brands for more than 4 years and never faced this issue so I surely it is not standard for all bluetooth devices and even my left bud is working fine only the right one is having problem I got no reply. Since I bought it less than a month ago so I asked for a replacement as they couldn't help me fix the issue. I got no response since then. But for getting a positive review they will send whatsapp reminder everyday and call you every alternate day without fail.

  I have heard great reviews on this product from some youtubers like technology jock and few others. I was quite interested on it listening to their highly positive views on this product.. only later after receiving it I understood they have been paid to promote it...The audio quality is pathetic just like a cheap Chinese wired earphones... After all even this is a Chinese product.. Am not meaning to sound biased infact I have been using some of Chinese products myself.. but this is a garbage. Not at all worth the price.. not even worth 1k. The quality of the earbuds is so plasticy that it feels so delicate.. it doesn't even fit your ear properly...

  This is my first TWS Bluetooth earbuds, after lot of research only I've bought this.First of all, the connectivity is swift, the moment it has been taken out from the case it'll get connected to the connected devices.+ Built quality is nice, soft feel, good material quality , elegant colour combo(imperial Jade), less weight, good fit in ears used more than 6hrs still having a good charge and connectivity. About charge will review after a week of usage.+ While connecting in mono, two earbuds can be connected to 2 mobile devices like L bud for one mobile and R bud to another one. But reconnecting the same as pair is little workout is needed.+ Range is quite good most of the times moving to different rooms yet the buds are managing+ Lovely magnetic case to hold the buds but together the buds doesn't have magnets. Don't miss the buds.+ Am not audiophile, so not going to write much about the separation, high low and mids.As a whole, the purpose gets solved. Like this much..

  The audio quality is superb. It has good bass which does not dominate the treble and vocals so you get a fairly balanced track. It performs well during calls but I'd recommend them if music was your priority.They fit great even during a work out.... but will slightly change position if you bend horizontally or go upside downThe noise cancellation was never going to be sound proof like. We live in India. But it gets the job done in music. Exterior noise will creep in a little if you are watching a movieThe pairing is quick. As soon as you wear them they pair with each other and announce "" left channel "" "" right channel "" and "" connected "".The charging is great. I doubt the 20 hour claim, but you can go 4-5 days without a charge. I can live with that.The look of green and copper is sexy af.... So it doesn't disappoint thereGo for it!

  I mean it's an average set of earphones, nothing special. The reviews online are honestly pretty misleading and dishonest. The case and even the earphones are made of plastic and not good quality.It's just disappointing to wait for the item with high hopes and overall they are not a comfortable pair to wear.Can't be used while running cause they fall right off. Not enough support for them to stay in. I recommend buying something else and don't make the same mistake I made.

  Sound quality was not so great on phone, but when I connected it to laptop it was little audible enough.I have experienced lot of connectivity issues and also when i tried increasing or decreasing the volume using the touch sensor it didn't actually work well, i thought it should be done in a rhythm of taps and waited for sometime practicing but still was of no use, i tried different things... connectivity is worse if i have to be brutally honest.And the first time when i charged the case with the headphone in it, it took approx 4 hours to charge.And i felt like i got the used product too.I bought Boat Rockerz 255F neckband which costed me 1500/- which connects very well and sounds loud enough.So, I can definitely say with my experience this is not a great product and not worth the money that we are spending although the headphones are beautiful looking ones.I am truly disappointed!

  When I saw the package and saw that it was green in colour I was a bit skeptical but then when I opened the box, I immediately liked it.Good build quality, durable case and the buds are good as well. They have already fallen out 3-4 time but have survived.Sound quality is good but won't call it 100% noise cancelling, specially not in the Indian traffic conditions which is where I use it most.A bit disappointed with the call feature. There have been instances where the caller on the other side could not hear me. Would need to hear someone with the same product to certify this bit.One problem I am not able to overcome is that these don't stay inside the ears and keep coming out. I am afraid of losing them sooner rather than later. Would need some help maybe in getting educated about the correct way to put them on.Overall, good quality product except for the calling bit. Range is also pretty good.Received the product pretty quickly after placing the order. Amazon really has mastered that bit

(5/5)Looks: Looks soooo premium with a rubbery touch. I choosed Green, it looks fantastic. Find the images attached.(5/5)Design: I cannot rate on this point because it depends on my Ears as well. For my ears i'm not happy with the 3 earbuds they provided. I'm using other earbuds and it fits perfectly in my ears. Gold coloured button looks amazing and giving a nice shades with light, but those are bit hard and produces sound when clicked. (NA/5)Call Quality: 1 thing i'm not happy with is call quality. When the room is quiet the other person is able to hear my voice, but it is outside so so noicy environment it really sucks.Battery life: Impressive so far.Overall - I'm using from last 4 days. Watched 3-4 movies and really enjoyed the audio quality, looks & battery are fantastic. I would have rated 5* if call quality is better.

  Its a so so product. In that price range go for Blupunkt true wireless. You will get that on 3999 rs. Bass is good but not awasome. Sound quality is also not much appeciating. Price is too high in the segment. Not getting the touch screen not also good quality sound. Main problem is noise cancellation. There is actually no noise cancellation. Trust me. Neither hd quality sound. Sometime it automatically disconnected. So no good feature in 4999 rs. Just imagine. Only good thing is battery backup. Dont buy this. Go for other product.

    Very detailed observations and review
  
","









  
  
    
  Have been using it for about a week.Initially when they arrived, i simply opened the package and directly put them in my ears. Felt the bass was low and sound was not that loud. But after 10 min of warming up they were sounding completely different. Base was awesomely punchy and deep also the sound was very loud. Fell in love with the base and sound quality within 10 mins.Highs mids and lows are also very clear, was able to hear parts of songs that i had never experienced specially the lows. To give an example, listen to atif aslam singing old songs. This is a concert recording available on YouTube and and when played in crossbeats pebble, i was even able to hear what the backstage people were shouting.Coming to battery life, the case took 1hr45min to charge from 0 to 100 without the buds in them and gave 4+ full charges to the buds.The buds on other hand took 1hr10min to charge completely and worked for 4+ hours continuously on single charge at 90% volume.Calling part is good for indoor situations but the buds struggle to capture your voice in traffic conditions (requires you to speak a but loudly).Noise cancellation is average and as a result the outdoor calling experience is not that great. The opposite person can hear you and understand you as well but the only issue is the background noise of the traffic which doesn't sound pleasant and can be irritatting on long calls. For indoor calling they work perfectly fine. However since i use them majorly for music amd rarely for calling in outdoor condition, it doesn't bother me at all. Also while listening to music outdoor, due to the perfect fit i got, i cannot hear even a single horn when the volume is 90%.Speaking about the fit, i tried all the 3 tips provided and eventually settled for the mid size tips which are default with the buds. Have been regularly using them while jogging, bike riding and in bed. Thay have never fallen from my ears nor have they ever felt loose in ears after prolonged use. The fit is perfect because of which the bass feels so strong. Also they are helmet friendly and doesn't come off even while wearing and removing the helmet. However i felt them slightly uncomfortable to wear in bed because of their thickness.Controlls seems good with the button but when you press them it pinches your ears slightly. However after a weeks use i have got used to it.Connectivity is another strong point here. I plug my phone to charging on side table and will be washing my face in the bathroom seperated by a concrete wall still there will be no lag as such. However there is noticable lag when using it for playing pubg. Also they automatically connect to my phone as soon as i take them out from the case.The build quality is also very sturdy. They have slipped from my hand twice while putting them back in case and still when connected they sounded perfect.To summarise it upPros1. Very clear, loud and crisp sound2. Very deep and punchy base3. Perfect fit4. Good battery backup5. Auto connects as soon as i take them out of the case6. Excellent build quality7. Pocket friendly because of the small case.8. Easy to insert the buds in case as they are magnetically guided.Cons1. Week noise cancellation at low volumes2. Not good for outdoor calling.3. If the case battery is completely exhausted, then the buds don't switchoff when inserted in the case and need to be switched off manually. I guess they recognise the case only with the charging and not with its magnetic fit.

  Pros:The mat finish on the case and the feel of the buds is really good.Has Type-C charging.Playback time 5-6 hrs on a single charge.Covers upto 30 feet from the device.Voice over calls is good. But can get messy when there is traffic/other disturbance.Cons:Gets really uncomfortable after 2 hours of usage. Ears start to pain.Buds feel little heavy.Connectivity is a hassle. If you use single bud and try to switch back to both the transition is not so great. One has to put them back into the case and take it out to reconnect.case looks a little too bulky.Charging cable is hardly 3-4 inches.Connectivity isn't so great.Multi function buttons are little sturdy.the sound quality is poor. the clarity or sound at 75% is equivalent to that of 40% of what my wired earphones are.

  BUILD :- Prity good actually, I'll go as far as to say better then the expensive counterparts for Ex- galaxy buds +, airpods etc. cause they give this glasses finish which scratches easily, slips out of your pocket easily etc etc. This gives robbery finish which doesn't do any of them.SOUND :- Prity good for the price, high's good, vocals good, bass decent (not as punchy as jbl's & other's in same price) lows are almost as good. So overall balance sound profile, you won't complain.BATTERY LIFE :- Nothing to crazy, around 4-5h with buds and 24h with the case for my 75% volume use.Over all:-I would say you won't regret your purchase given the price 4,999 or less. Great build quality, good balance sound profile, great battery life.

  I will give 4 rating for these ear buds. I'm not a heavy user. I'll use these ear buds for 1 to 1.5 hours a dayPros -1. Sound quality - Really nice. Clarity of sound is clear and listening music is great on this product. I guess for a heavy user they might feel pain(which might be true for any other brands also) but for 30 mins or 1 hour it is nice.2. Noise cancellation - This is a surprise. I've not expected the devise to provide  great  noise cancellation but it exceeded the expectations . 5/53. Battery - Really good battery life for normal users.4. Call quality - This is one of the primary reasons why I bought them. Till now I've not faced any issues and I'm happy with the call quality. Even the other party was able to hear me clearly.Cons1. I think they don't fit into ears perfectly so there is always a chance that you may drop them. It happened with me couple of times but no damage done. So For normal walking they work perfect but for Treadmill / for jogging they won't work.2. The ear buds pop up from ear too often so I reduced rating to 4

  Visually the product is amazing. But performance is really below average. Noise cancelation is great but im assuming it's cause of the fact they're in-ear Volume is as if im listening at 50% volume. Returned it in 5 minutes of testing. Don't buy it!

  Made in India at its best. I had ordered after studying the reviews of bunch of headphones. And thought would promote made in india.The review :The headphones are excellent. The connection was prompt and and paired easily to both IPhone and OnePlus.Sound was crisp and clear with good bass. Call quality was great although a little lag in speaking during the call.Control on buds are great. You can skip a song, pause it, increase volume and call for Siri, or Ok Google. Works flawlessly.They snugly fit, and stays on during workout. They don‚Äôt come out from ears. They are light in weight.The only issue with it which I had was the box of buds were faulty it did not charge or auto disconnect on keeping the buds.It‚Äôs a great bud that too made in India. Kudos to team Crossbeats. We will be the best in the world.

  I had been trying to get a decent true wireless earphones lately and as it was the Amazon sale which was happening...I bought three different earphones within a budget..first I bought a ptron true wireless which costed around 999 which wasn't good at all interm of audio quality and the connectivity for making phone calls. Then i upgraded to an bit more expensive one seeing the reviews and comments on this product hoping it will be worth it but when I received it it's fair interms of audio quality but not as good as mentioned in the product details..no noise cancellation, the audio was breaking in an out. After pausing a song from the laptop or phone it takes time to play in the synced mode..it has a super delay or lag in playing video files. When phone calls were made the audio from wasnt clear to the receiver and made the receiver hard to hear my voice clearly as if a person is talking from a distance of 10 meters away from the phone..a normal wired earphones worth ‚Çπ500  sounds clear and better than these though the built and design factors are average so paying 4k and above isnt advisable and definitely not worth it. All the products have the made in China engraved on it

  I am writing this review after using these headphones for 2 days. Battery and Build quality is good enough but comfort is not so, left earpiece keeps falling off, changing ear tips didn‚Äôt help much, so exercising with these is not recommended, could fall off and you would lose them if not careful.Sound is good enough for the price and notice cancellation is also good, cuts off background noises.What bothered me the most is the mic quality, if you‚Äôre putting both the ear pieces and call someone then the person at the other end is not able to hear you clearly, it‚Äôs like sound is coming from far away and that too with echo. Only if you keep one ear piece in ear and other near your mouth then you‚Äôll be audible enough for the other person to hear you clearly.Had to return them as I didn‚Äôt find them up to the mark for my needs.

  I got these ear phones during Amazon Prime day. After looking at a lot of options I zeroed in on these ear phones, based on the number and quality of reviews. And I am quite pleased with them.Packaging:Solid packaging. Really appreciate the effort put into this to give it that premium feel, even before pulling it out of the box.Fit and finish:Excellent!- Box snaps shut with a nice sound and opens also quite firmly. Nice feeling- The material is nice to the touch- Buttons on the ear phones have a nice click, which is great- LED lights on the back (for the unit and ear phones separately) is informativeAudio quality:When I first used them I found them quite bassy. This probably works for most people, though. Over time, I have got used to it and have begun to use them quite often.All in all a great purchase and highly recommend if you want a product with good fit and finish, as long as you are not completely averse to bassy notes.

    Couldn't deliver on the First Impressions- Had to return
  
","









  
  
    
  The first thing you notice is that the product is eye catching and build well externally. But the internal components didn't withstand everyday use. The sound features of device are of acceptable standards, nothing mind blowing. As wireless earbuds technology is still in its inception, companies like CrossBeats couldn't deliver on quality standards. In my case the right earbud started disconnecting intermittently since the first day. After few days the earbuds didn't connect to my laptop too. I tried resetting and pairing them again, but my efforts were futile. Finally the right earbud stopped working and I had to return my set. I really wished this not to happen. But small ventures like CB have to take product quality as their priority as I believe people can bear the product being not upto their expectations but not a faulty product which do not works.

  The reason i purchased it was because i researched about TWS budget earphones a lot and it met all my conditions for purchasing it. After using it for 3-4 days it just worked fine, but shortly after i was introduced to its demerits such as laggy connections, heating of earbuds and sound delay. No doubt the sound quality is good but after considering the overall factors it didn't feel worth it to buy the product. Also it may be my personal problem but after using it for more than 1 hr my ear canal started ache and it pains.Now lets talk about its features -Sound - Good.Battery life - 3hrs after on single charge.(And you can charge it 2 more times only though it is written it can used for 20hrs i did not get even close to it)Performance - Many issues faced.Buttons - Good

  Best thing about the product is that The build is TOOOOOOO GOOD.But don't get carried way with that.Let me just give pros and cons.PROS:‚¶ø Build Quality with great case. With two days of  having it have already dropped it several times  but not a scratch.‚¶ø Great Battery Life.‚¶ø Buds charging in case is pretty quick although  case charging takes some time even though it  has type c support.‚¶ø Connects with phone very quick. By the time u  have wore it, its already connected.‚¶ø I loved the button control of the buds. It's better  than the touch sense control.CONS:‚¶ø Not great sound quality. Loudness is there but  sometimes i feel sound is distorting.‚¶ø No noise cancellation. Although you won't be  able to hear the surrounding if you are at MAX  volume, But thats not suggested.‚¶ø Call quality is not good at all. All my friends  mentioned that your voice is distorted take  yourself off speaker but i was using this.‚¶ø Sometimes one bud gets automatically  disconnected and reconnects automatically.‚¶ø The bluetooth connection lacks sometimes as if  u are watching a video u can feel the lips and  audio are not synced but if u disconnects and  reconnect then it works fine.‚¶ø When i was jogging my phone was in my pocket  and song audio was not continuous as in the  audio was beaking but when i kept in my hand  then it worked fine.FINAL VERDICT:There aren't many great true wireless buds at this range. U have to make peace with these mediocre true wireless BUDS.If u can extend ur budget then please GO for some reputed brand products. Better to buy wireless earphones rather going for these true wireless stuff at this price range.I hope in future great true wireless buds will be common. The technology is pretty new and will improve with time.

  Used for 10 days and returned it, due to Bluetooth connectivity issues and while playing music when you stop playing, it disconnects, then you have to connect both earbuds first, and then connect to the device again, which is very tiresome, I've resetted several times but it couldn't connect immediately and if it connects only one of the two earbuds will work(either left or right one).Some of the Pros during 10 days:- Really liked it, fits right into the ear. Sound quality is very good- Just don't play music in full volume (play around 75-85% volume), rest everything is good.- Bass is deep and clear, good for workout.

Here's my overall impression and detailed reviewsThese TWS earphones are AWESOME, especially for the price. They have great noise cancelling capabilities, and really great sound quality - deep booming bass and crisp mids and highs (make sure you select the correct size of rubber squishies for your personal comfort however). The case is super cute, and I love the matte finish and leather cord - the size is also pretty great. They're also super easy to use, and usually connect quite rapidly. There are however a few minor issues , in terms of function and design - but they do not impact my overall impression of the earphones, your mileage may vary.PROS:- Super stylish design- Great sound quality- Reasonable pricing (Depending on what you're looking for)- 3 Free months of Gaana (If you're spending Rs. 4000+ on earphones, you probably already have some sort of music subscription such as Spotify or Apple Music though, so this may not be as much of a perk)- High quality finish and product quality- Decent warranty-Solid microphone sound qualityCONS -- No charge indicator for the case (Some earphones in this price segment do have this feature)- Standard charging cable for the case is hilariously short, you'll almost definitely need to use a different one unless you only charge off your laptop- Tradeoff of portability for battery life (5 full charges is not bad though - although 10-20 can be found in comparable items)- Physical Multifunction Button works fine , but Touch Sensitive MFB would've been better- Switching between devices is not always very smooth - ability to connect to multiple devices and switch between would be great.Overall though - great device, really good for the price. Strongly recommend for a variety of purposes/

    Crossbeats pebble- a balanced listening experience, with a terrible voice model

  First impressions: very light, minimalistic, well designed case, combined with a fashionable leather string, and coated with a nice rubbery finish, very high build quality overall. Feels very premium to hold,  quite solidly built.After using them for a while;Firstly, the lid is the most solid I've felt so far- absolutely no rattle or play in the hinge, and the snap is very distinct and clicky. Very happy with that.What I'm a little disappointed with, is the fact that the earphones have physical buttons on them- perhaps I'll get used to this after a while, but anything that moves, breaks. The earphones themselves are also well built otherwise, no visible seams or artefacts.Sound quality: Very loud, balanced sound. As shown in the picture, I've been using the wings power pods for a while now, and compared to them, the sound quality of these is slightly worse in my opinion. Now, this is solely my opinion- what I can objectively say however, is that the wings have WAY stronger bass. If you're looking for the best bass experience possible on true wireless buds, I would suggest those. Really, it sounds like you're sitting in front of the subwoofer at a concert, quite incredible.These however provide a more balanced audio experience. Clearer highs and mediums, resulting in more of the words of a song to be heard clearly, whereas bass heavy ones like the wings tend to blur the words more.These are not NOISE CANCELLING earphones, what people mean is noise isolation, and in that these excel. When listening, you can't hear anything from the outside, 5/5 in that department.The thing I probably HATE THE MOST, is the absolutely incredibly cringey Chinese voice saying 'right channer' and 'reft channer' and 'connactad'Overall I'm quite happy with them, despite not having used then for long. Good job crossbeats

  After using the earphones for couple of days. I can I think for sure they are definitely worth the price. Wonderful base and very true audio output. The finish is nice and grippy for our usual heavy work outs and has nice noise cancelation but a little lower than the evolve series earphones. If you are looking for a great set of earphones this should be your choice.

    Poor after sale service even for products under warrenty
  
","









  
  
    
  Call quality is seamlessly poor. Sound quality is fine and the mids are balanced. I faced an issue (unclear, unnecessary noise) in the left bud. Asked service center to help, yet the process of getting the product under warrenty checked was a complex, cumbersome, tiring task as they started hassling by asking unnecessary details. They only have single service center in Bangalore. So for me as a customer, the after sale experience has been a downhill ride.

  Like the details say, has a tendency to emphasize the bass more, like in a pop song than the treble and the mids, like in a rock song. But a good sound quality nonetheless. If you want a earbud that is protable and handles every genre fairly good, then go for it. The only complaint I have is that when you turn the volume up or down from the earbuds, it beeps. I would like them to not do that.

  This headset is so small that no one will even notice you are wearing a headset in your ear which makes this a ideal choice. If you are looking for a headset fir YouTube vids, what's app audio/vids or for taking calls this is the best headset. Even for listening to music is also good nice bass but only in one ear. If are ok with it then look no further just buy it. Its a steal at 799 Rs.Giving 4 stars because there is no charging case for this which is why it is very easy yo lose. I lost one already. This is the second one I bought. By the way it has 5-6 hrs of music or call time in one charge which is enough for a day.

I received the black pouch without the boult audio logo, i dont know whether its original or not.3. No stamp of seller on warranty card which may void you from warranty.4.

  I was very skeptical initially because there was too many good reviews and too many bad ones.But I didn't have much of a choice because I badly needed a monopod and nothing came at this price from a trustworthy brand and this was my best bet.When I got it, I couldn't believe the delivery of this product's music. It was delightful. I didn't imagine that something this tiny could deliver so much. The bass is truly unbelievable because you wouldn't expect much given the fact that it's not immersive as it's only for one year. But it's very very distinctive.Anyway, let's break down the pros and the absolute limited cons for this little cracker ;)PROS> Extremely reliable thanks to it's unbelievable battery life.> Wonderful call quality> Premium look and finish> Crisp music output> Almost invisible (Making it super fun for use in situations that require discretion)> quick chargingCONS> Since it's kinda tiny, it's susceptible to getting lost easily(I wish it came with a mini case)> There's no option to change the song cuz according to the manual I gotta double click it but what happens is it calls the last dialed number.Which is still fine given the far outweighing pros.Just go for it. Best budget Monopod.

  To be honest while purchasing i thought it would be a great product but it turns out that it's not. Bluetooth connectivity is a hectic process, automatically gets disconnected while talking on phone or listening to music, if you receive an incoming call our voice is not audible at all to the other person. The Power On/Off button doesn't function properly. Since it's delivery on last Saturday it worked 3 days properly but since yesterday the problem has started. Spending so much money and the product doesn't live upto your expectations then it's a shame. Such products should be banned on Amazon. Please don't buy, it's a waste of money. It's better to purchase Airpods from a renowned shop rather then wasting money on such imposters. Dissappointed with Amazon too for providing such fake products in their E-Commerce Website.

  Guys,This device after seeing rating I bought it from Amazon and thanks to Amazon for prompt on time delivery. Coming to device I use it for listening music and this device working great for me. I will put my review simpleSound Quality: very decent Bass. You can got to upto 70 out of 100 to hear song with good bass. Also, in the office it will clam I hear less sound and trust it became a good friend enjoining music while working. Just an FYI, am not a heavy sound listener.Battery life: Good, in a day I almost use this for two hours no where signal drop and once I completely charge I'm using it for 3days as they said continuously 6hrs we can use I hardly useit for receing calls. So from battery life perspective it's goodEasy to use: in my ear it perfectly fits. I even shake my head the grip was so good it never fell down. I liked it very much. But, I tried tofit in my mom's and dads ear it was falling and not sitting or has good grip. For them I don't know what to do. In my case I would give 5/5 points.Calls: if you are driving I believe you would have closed glasses so receiving calls is fine and their voice is crystal clear our voice for them is not that clear and if you're walking on the road other people talking to us they are saying that some background noise coming. This will not be there if are in closed room or car and not outside. So here I give 3/5 points. Irrespective of whether you're in car or closed room or outside incoming voice is very very clear.Overall decent and good device.

  I called a Friend when I was riding my scooty and I could hear her and everything was good but she couldn't hear me because more than my voice it was the noise she could hear from my background.

So I think it is really very bad and doesn't cancel the noise when someone else is listening to you.

Gets a nice leather like pouch inside the box. Charging time is also less comparatively. If your usage is only for taking calls, you can buy this.

The pod look very premium and it very small in size. Built quity is very good. Believe me, the battery is so good that it lasts for almost 3 days on medium usage, as i a medium user. I have used it for calls and listing songs for 3-4 hours contineously but still almost 25% battery left by end of day. It even charges faster within 1-1.5 hours fully. Quality of sound is awesome and clear. Talk tones are very clear and crisp with noise cancellation and music sounds are also very good. Remember, its built for calls, so performs best in that. It can connect upto 2 devices at a time max. No issues due to sweat as its sweat proof. Fits very smoothly into ear and does not hurt. Can be used for very long hours with any pain. You can recieve watsapp calls but cant talk through this. Range is around 30m or so. All in all a very good product at this price range. I have just used it for 3 days and m very happy with it.

  Very nice product. Needs a little adjustment to fit into your ear hole but that's just a couple of hours matter.Pros:1. Light weight2. Awesome sound quality & noice cancellation3. You can clearly hear and the person on the other end on the phone as well even if you are out in a crowded place.4. As of now one charge is lasting for 2 days with normal use.5. Not suitable for music or movie or gaming. This is a device for telephony while keeping your hands free so use it responsibly.Cons:1. The charging cable is very short.I got it in 650/- from Amazon and really happy with the purchase. Now a days, when mask and spec already making the burden too much for the ear drums this little device fits in perfectly, giving the ears a much needed comfort that you are looking for us.

  Good product at this price. Box contains a short charging cable without any power adapter,the monopod, an extra pair of ear bud and the instruction manual. All these are contained in a pouch. The monopod is small and can easily be misplaced. Sound quality is ok. Also after first pairing with phone you need not pair again. Battery life is also good. The monopod contains one multifunction button with led.

  Update: Yes, it can connect to two devices. I first paired it with my phone. Then switched off BT on phone, and then off/on headset and paired with my laptop. Then switched on BT on phone. Both are connected. Though, if you get a call and take it on the phone, to switch back to laptop, you've to disconnect and connect it again on laptop. Secondly, the standby mode seems to be pretty good - I left it connected through the day and it was showing 100%.I needed something for calls and listening to podcasts as a standby to my regular Oneplus Bullets 2 (which is pending repair till end of lockdown). This, and Jabra Talk 5 were the main contenders. Jabra supports 2 devices, but not music/podcasts and is a larger. This doesn't seem to support 2 devices. Anyway, after using it for 3 days I am reasonably happy. 0 to 100% charge happens in just about an hour; retains charge for some 2 hours of continuous listening at 60% volume. The touch control works very well and the fit inside the ear is very secure. This is not for listening to music really because the sound is loud and bass filled (I prefer neutral signature) and it is a mono device. Calls on are very good and there is no disturbance to people on the other side - well, there is no noise isolation, so whatever your phone mic picks up will get picked up in this too. Power on and connection are very quick - so much that I keep it off all the time and when I get a call, just turn it on and put it on the ear - by the time you do that, it connects. Connection can drop at times - I keep this on my left year and phone on my left trouser pocket and the connection goes off if I turn my head fully to the left (which you won't do lot of times, but still as an example, I am writing that). It works across walls for 2 rooms, so you can walk around a little bit while on calls.  Another thing I observed is that battery drops to 70%, 60%, 30% and 10%. Once it gets to 10%, it keeps saying ""battery low"" every 5 seconds or so and dies out completely in about 5 minutes.  Overall, not bad value for the money. Also, note that it is very black in color and if you put it on piano black surfaces like laptop lid, it is almost impossible to see. Plus it doesn't have the blinking light while it is on - very good!

Charging is done thru a very old 500ma charger and battery performance is still quite good, atleast more than 3 hours. Sound quality is quite good.

  I'm using Bluetooth headsets since last 8 years...plantronics, jabra, Sony single ear headset.  The speciality of this Bluetooth is it's price and quality it's offering. I have been using it since one month and then thought of reviewing it.Once in a day it looses it's connection. That's fine. It takes 5 seconds to reconnect it. The sound quality is good if not exceptional at this price point. The fit , it's tiny size and it's looks have impressed me so much that I purchased another as a spare.  It's battery life is just amazing.Few people have complained about carry pouch... which is totally unnecessary for this product. Even if you have carry pouch, I bet you won't use it more than 2 days.Just go for it if you are interested in unipod Bluetooth.

  The size, pudh button and finishing everything is good of this product. Looks is really appealing (specially the chrome outline border of button). It fits perfectly to my ear.Now coming to sound, the sound quality is quite good, bass is okay. Even you can not expect a high quality bass from monopod in this price range (my petsonal opinion). Noise cancellation is not that much good. I'm using it while I'm cycling and as it's a monopod so I can hear my surrounding sound. Call receiving features is also working fine as of now.But the battery backup is not up to the mark. Battery life stays maximum for 2.5 hours. Charging time is less, you can count this one also as a positive point of this product.So overall I'd say you can go for it. You can use it to your daily life activity like gyming, cycling. It'll not come out easily from your ear.That's all today, from my side.Stay safe, stay happy :)

  This is arguably the best bluetooth mono earphones available in the market. The fit is very good, so not really worried about it accidentally falling off.

The phone calls are very clear and it was quite a surprise coming from such a compact mono earphone.Mine stopped working after a few weeks, though. Planning to send it for warranty as soon as the covid situation is under control in my area. Will update on how it goes through with the warranty.

  For those who like watching content on Youtube or OTT platforms, and are not tok particular about bass etc. this is perfect. Had connectivity issues once or twice, but switching off the device once or twice worked. But the one con is that calls are not clear. So I dont use the monopod for speaking on the phone. It would have been great if I could have done that as well , but for sub 1000 Rs, I cant ask for more. Usually charge only once in 2-3 days since I am a light user. Also it charges really fast. So overall quite happy with the product.

  Excellent.... this is one of the finest products I have ever purchased from Amazon. Most reviews of others say that it's only for calling & receiving calls. It's much more than that... Just listen to music with this miracle piece .. see its bass.. treble... clarity. Once fully charged, gives 3 hrs of nonstop music... it's indeed a mini magic.... superb nano earbud...Planning to Buy one?? ... no need to think twice... go for it.... satisfaction guaranteed...

  Good and perfect for the cost. Kindly dont think about noise cancellation as this is a monopod and you can hear the outdoor sound from the other ear. But great if we use it in a closed room. Good sound quality, reasonable bass and serves the purpose of tiny earpods at this cost. Receives our voice clearly even though it is from your mouth. U'll definitely forget that ur wearing one after sometime. Great product. Happy with it. Need to be a lil bit careful where u place it as it a very tiny product. Chances of losing it is more.

  What I like-Earphone is really good.Charge stays for at least three hours.Good audio to listen to music and for talk.No disturbance while talking.Size is wonderful,very lightweight.I have to thank I ball for that also for selling at this price.What I dislike-  There is a design issue that earphone doesn‚Äôt sit in the ear firmly.It falls off the ear without our knowledge while we are concentrating on something else.Also I was afraid of going to places where it used to be wet,because if it falls in water it will go dead.  I request I ball to do some design changes in this set to make it stay in the ear firmly while walking or while cycling or while exercising.Otherwise I would have given five stars for this set.

  Good product at this price point. Sound quality is good. Easily get paired with device. Battery backup is very good. Almost 5-6 hrs.But still need to improve noise cancellation, as it sometimes cancel your voice along with noise. Microphone or call work well when you are walking or running. Will not give you best results when you are traveling on bike or in train, specifically if you want to use as handsfree wearing a helmet it will not give you desire results.

  The first thing to be noted is, it's not a pair of earbuds, which means there's only a single piece and you can use it in either ear. This can cause irritability as only one ear is covered. Still the sound quality is really good. Good bass, the sound is pretty clear. Unfortunately, I experience a little buzz when in ideal mode, which I have not been able to stop till now (not sure if this happens for everyone or every device). But overall yes, I would recommend these, it is value for money. Battery life also seems to be good. Another concern could be that it is manufactured in China. I was under the impression that iBall is India and manufactures locally but that is not the case. If you have a better budget then you could probably try some other brand as well.

  This is very imbalanced earphones. Right side comes out of ear because of mic and battery. Battery performance is not upto the mark. 2 calls of 30 minutes in total drained 30% battery, so not good as mentioned on paper. Mic is also not good, other person complaining that sometimes they can't hear single word and fan running in background. So mic is also not good.Sound is good but no bass. Is just okaish for sound.It has 2 secs lag when play video. This I noticed later on. This actually makes things weird with this. I want to return it but you can only replace this with same item. So not useful.

  Rs799 is really cheap for this earphoneHere's the thing. It's not neckband earphone, there's another model at 999 for that.If you want to run, jog do yoga or just plain relax. This pair is good.Here's the thing, the wire is long. If yiu want it to stay and not dangle. Use the small sports buckkle provided. It's the blue diac shaped plastic.The bass is almost nonexistent. The music and vocal are good. The range is good.The best part is is bluetooth 5.0That means it uses Bluetooth low energy, so unlike 4.2 the battery drain is less.Now, you want good music buy neckband or the bluetooth headphones. You want sports! Walk oriented bluetooth earphones at lower cost. This is  your best bet.

  Pros1. Multi device connectivity (Doesn't work perfectly but hey its a good feature on a 800rs device)2. Good sound signature (Surprisingly loud and clear)3. Fairly water resistant (Took out it in light rains and it works just fine)4. Decent Battery Backup (I got around 4.5 hours of music playback on this one)Cons:1. Very Bad fit. I had a huge pain making the right earbud fit in my ear (as it constantly comes out)Overall a good set of earphones for the price, I just wish they invested a litlle more on the FIT aspect of this earphones which ruins the otherwise good experience

  Under 800 rupees these wireless earphones one of the cheapest you can get but battery is not as expected , I am hardly getting 3.5 hrs of battery life after a full charge, after 50% battery is consumed, the device is complete drained under 30 min.I think there is some software glitch or they have done it on purpose.Well coming to sound quality , sound loudness is good and overall quality is fine. If you are looking only for wireless earphones with extremely tight budget then you may consider it, I suggest to spend some more money and buy a better earphones with atleast 6 hrs of battery life.

  1st day - So far it's okay and sound quality is good.

It beeped thrice with few seconds gap and got turned off in the middle of a call.When I connected it to charge and immediately turned it ON it was 30% battery. Don't know why it turned off.

Since the price was since the price was 5 fold lesser than my best product and 3 fold than my cheapest, I had no hopes and well how that turned to be worst assumption of the year.The sound is way superior and i would pick this any time of the day over those neck bands.If you not gonna be running with this thing on, this one is perfect for you.

  For design 3 star, for comfort 1 start. Case looks premium, but buds have cheap plastic. Bass is good. Spear should have been tilted a beat so that sound and bass is heard properly. For Bass  4 star. Wrt to other buds you need to keep sound a much hight for same output.  For design, I will give 4 star, innovative dolphin design , but inner plastic should have been a bit softer like case material for a bit more comfort. If manufacturers listen and with same outer design if inner design comes with silicon buds for better fit, it will sell more. Should also provide different size buds. For calls I will give 3 star, as you need to speak a bit higher for other person to listen you. Haven't checked outside with noisy environment. And just received so for battery back up also can't tell much.

  I was searching for TWS headphones and bumped on this one!the specs and price looked like a good deal, and it turned out to be a good deal for real! üòçPros:- comes with type C fast charger.- Full charge lasts for about 5+ hours of music.- Fits in ears' perfectly and has a great battery life- Much better than Redmi buds S for the cost this package offers!- Works flawlessly in gaming mode - PubG, NFS.- Premium look and matte finish on the case.Cons:- Earbuds could have a variable rubber size (to suit ear canal)- It took me time to charge on the first.go and it by default works only on mono mode (would have been better if both buds were pre-paired.-If priced under 750 this would be a perfect replacement for Collar and other bluetooth devices as it is very sturdy and pocket friendly

  Pros1) Satisfactory sound quality (don‚Äôt expect much from a 1000rs price point)2) Excellent battery life3) Excellent Bluetooth connectivity4)No lags (as far as I used)Cons1) Not so comfortable design.  (Solution: it fits loosely. feels like it is about to fall down any time. Because of that we try to push it more inside and that‚Äôs where we start to feel uncomfortable So don‚Äôt try to push it more inside. When u get used to the loose fit it won‚Äôt be a problem. If u want to buy a TWS for tight fit or workout at this price point then there r other alternatives with inear silicon buds like Ptron)For people who where using expensive wired or TWS headsets understand that u won‚Äôt get that premium sound quality or seamless connectivity in this one or any other TWS at this price point.

Worked great with 13mm bass speakers.2) Build quality is good and case cover has very good mate finish.3) I found it better than other earbuds like Realme buds because of it's shape and sound quality.4) Bluetooth 5.0 makes the connection seamless and instant.5) The battery backup is very good, lasts for almost 4-4.5hours and it gets charge quickly as well with type-c charging.

  It's really economical and perfect to use earpods! The case is beautiful.They are the ear shaped earpods which have a really good hold once you adjust into your ear, it will not drop. With capability to work individually they make a perfect pair, like for office use I can use them alternatively and the whole day passes without a though about charging.Overall, they are small, sleek with really good battery capacity and with the price range, a really amazing product to buy!

  I am reviewing after 3 days of use.Amazing product under Rs. 1500. I suggest to buyBattery backup is really good after some 30min of charging I had used those earbuds continuously for 5 hours and with charging case I am still using it without charging the case a single timeBass is pretty descent in this budget. Noise cancellation is not available but loud and clear sound compensate this mostly.It is also comfortable in ears due to its matt and rubbery finishing.But the point where I am little disappointed is that it could have silicon tips, so that the fittings would be much secure and more comfortable. In my left ear it is slightly loose.Rests are amazing at the budget. One must consider it.

  My wife received this in the morning, and I could only use it after 8pm, after coming from office. I have an HONOR 9 lite mobile  handset.Pros:1.Good features look wise, case is nice but the earpods are a bit plasticy, don't have that matt finish as the box, but it's OK.2.Price quite commendable.3.Good sound quality4.No external sound disturbance while in call.5.Battery life yet to judge.6.Best part is it's fit, it's snug and yes the dolphin design fits comfortably in the ears. No big earbuds and fancy stuff, and I guess won't pain even after hours of use.Cons :1.Worst connectivity issue.2.Once idle it not only gets disconnected, but also gets powered off and unpaired from the mobile device, though its fully charged.I will try it for few more days, if this connectivity issue persists I will surely return, and ask for a refund.Overall I can rate it 3 wrt a 2 hours usage.

  Got this wonderful budget TWS earphones delivered yesterday evening and was quite amazed by the battery life.Battery Life:Started using them after charging them in the dock for an hour and started using them. The battery life in buds lasted more than 4 hours.Also the charging case gets full charge in approx 90 min and 15 min of single charge to buds lasted for an hour as they have promised.Sound Quality:It gives good sound quality while hearing songs on music apps or watching videos on YouTube. Bass is good and I literally don't care about other things.13mm drivers does make a difference. I would not recommend this TWS for playing games as I found a lag while playing PUBG.Connectivity:Seamless bluetooth connectivity and it does connect instantly to your phone just by taking the buds out of charging case and disconnects instantly as well just by placing them back.Fitting:It does fit easily into my ears and doesn't fall off. Thought they are made of plastic, we shouldn't expect much considering the cost of the product.Value for Money:Considering the features it gives and the cost of the product, I would recommend this product for music listening people or video watching ones.

  First issue I had with this is FALSE ADVERTISING.let me make it clear, this product is MADE IN CHINA, not Germany.Second- Bad fit. It barely stays in your ears,and even is there is slight wind blowing when you're outside ,it can knock these out of your ears.Third- Poor build quality. Cheap plastic cases stuck together. Will open up if they fall from one feet height. I received a damaged product, which had loose parts inside it ,which you can hear rocking inside when shaked.Fourth- Bad connectivity. The second pair I received after replacing the first pair ,was really annoying when it came to connectivity. One side would keep losing sound or get disconnected and you would repeated hear ""connected/disconnected"" in one war while the other one would keep playing your stuff. Annoying AF.WORST THOUSAND RUPEES SPENT.But what else would you expect from a Chinese product sold under false advertisement.#CKMKB

  Saw the product and could not believe the specifications @ Rs. 999/-. Ordered immediately and received the next day. Opened up the package and was happy to see that the product was genuine and the look and feel of the box and earpods were pretty good. The digital display was working well and the battery was 95%. Picked up the earpods and it paired seamlessly with the phone. After this my frustration started. Firstly the fitting in the ear was not good and it felt like it would fall off. Secondly, Either one of the earpod was getting connected and I had to keep pressing the switch area to keep the other pod connected. Sometimes right sometimes left, sometimes none. It was a pathetic experience.Sound quality was loud and clear but bass was simple. I kept on trying by switching on and off repeatedly but the same problems persisted. So finally I decided to return the same.Maybe I received a defective product. So genuinely interested buyers kindly take decision at your own risk.

  I am very disappointed with the quality of these headphones.The pair I first received initially had a problem of breaking voice. Be it music or call, sound was breaking even on slight movement of neck. So I was unable to make any call or listen music on move.I requested replacement which I received soon but unfortunately that pair also had the same issue. Even the second pair had a new problem of frequent disconnection. My call was disconnecting frequently so I was unable to use them to make or receive a call.Now I am returning them for full refund.I will never ever suggest these earbuds.

  The best ever Bluetooth Ear Buds I have ever experienced.It is way best and better than any other brands.It is really comfortable for the ears and when coming to the sound quality it is really the best and superb sound quality.The Bass limit is really bigger which is more than 13mm which gives very good effect.Battery backup is really amazing with the best performance.It is really best when compared with Realme Buds.It is highly recommended.

  Sound quality is good but there is problem with connection it always disconnect between the music and playing movies.. sometimes sound will also lacks..Built quality is cheap.. but it connects fast with the phone and also there is no buds thats why it does not fits in to the ear and after half and hour it pains in to the ear..because it mouth is big and our ear is small so that's why it's dolphin design bites our ear very rude..üòÇüòÇ

  I would like to say that i bought this earbuds in 899 in the prime day sale and i think it it the best earbuds in this range.The sound is fabulous üòçüëåüëåTereble and bass is also good..The only cons is that is must have that silicon in ear then it might be the best earbuds in this range of below 1000.

    Good product marred by bad design
  
","









  
  
    
  This product had excellent build quality, sound output is good and so is connectivity.But its sadly let down badly by a poor design which does not fit majority of ears - it just pops out with even a slight head movement. Thus, making it unsuitable for walking let alone brisk walking...and don't even think of running with them.  Maybe it was made to fit small earholes (comes from China).Anyway, I returned them since it was a gift. One side input - the delivery was super duper fast but return took 8+ days! And so obviously the refund. How come?

    poor product quality, dismal customer service
  
","









  
  
    
  This was purchased for my kids to help in their online classes.  The product turned out unsafe.1. Charge goes down very fast.2. Was used hardly for a week ( 5 days) and while charging it gave away a very unpleasant plastic odour. Turned out the charging box got burnt. How safe can this be? I am really shocked.3. Contacted customer support online, was asked to mail additionally, and then via WhatsApp. Understandable since it is pandemic times. But almost 10 days since I placed the complaint and no proper response from their team.4. I was asked the details of the charging adapter and I posted the details too but they have come with nothing.Very poor experience. Usually at least customer service was satisfactory when products failed in Amazon. Staff were really empathetic. This is worst in that department too.

  One of the worst decision of my life to choose truke, they are brand like Germany but having quality like third class Chinese, i bought after reading so many review, beleive me it's sound like 50 rupees Chinese earphone, Connection dropping frequently, and one the best shocking news is, that is not returnable, you can't return this. Means you are going to waste your thousands bucks, guys i request you kindly avoid this brand, they advertising like Germany, but having a worst quality in their products.

    Fitting is not at all good.
  
","









  
  
    
  I bought this for 999 Rs from Great Indian Festival in Amazon.Firstof all the main thing i would like to point is the Fitting of the buds in the ear. Not at all good and it pains while wearing. Also we get fear of falling of earbuds from the ear. Although they have unique Dolphin design but still it is not at all Recommended.Sound Quality is not at all as expected with 13mm drivers. Although having 13 mm dynamic driver its sound was not that loud and bass was also not there. It was like a normal earphones sound.Battery backup is Awesome but Dont compromise with Sound as it was not at all expected.I thought that it hase 13 mm big driver so the sound would be extra large and also it will be bass boosted but it was not like that so.They sound redesign this in as inear earbuds not like this so that we can wear this without any pain in ear.

  Read all the reviews which was so good before buying but i m disappointed with this piece. Firstly it doesnt stat in the ears properly. It drops off itself. So many times it dropped on the floor. Secondly not so good for calls as well...lot of complains from the other side of the call that they cant hear or they hear from distance etc.One thing thats really good is the sound quality ...so its good to watch movies or listen to music..otherwise not cool.

    Poor connectivity
  
","









  
  
    
  Sound quality is better, bass is good, battery back up is best. The main problem is that the earbuds geta DISCONNECTED momentarily for a few seconds when the head moves. Say you reside your head in a position stationary for sometime and starts to move, then the earbuds gets disconnected for a few seconds and is really irritating to the ears. If you walk or jog it becomes WORST.Sound Quality: 3/5Bass Quality: 3/5Built: 4/5Fit : 2/5Music overall: 3/5Quality : 2/5Replaced it twice but issue persists though the frequency of the issue the secind one was less.. Finally returned it..And its made in PRC.

  I bought this product having expections of 1000 rs worth. But honestly I wouldn't have paid more than 200 rupees for this crap. It's not a ideal fit and the sound quality is crap. Apart from that connection is poor if you move 5m away from your phone it would get disconnected. My ideal purpose was to use it for workout but as I said not a right fit it would keep falling. I wish I could return this and get my money back.

  I just bought this Truke Fit Pro true wireless bluetooth headset. Recd it on 31/07/2020.Registered on truke site on 01/08/2020 and got an email confirmationGerman design - made in ChinaOn the box pricing is 4,999 / On the site it is 1190 / Deal price 999. So what is it worth.On a very lay man level initial analysis.Build quality - Very plastic feel. Charging box looks good.Very simple to use. Gets paired automatically.Battery life - still checking, will update after a few days. 500mAh Charging Case with Type-C Universal will provide round the day support.Calls - no disturbance/issuesDistance - working well with 9-10 mts rangeFit - may not be like by everybody, Little uncomfortable/slight pain till we get used to. wouldn't just fall off, but feels so. Bud type would have been better.13mm Dynamic Driver Speakers - delivers decent good sound qualityOverall basically price was the only factor to pick this model.

  No fitting issues, quiet comfortable. Built quality is awesome. You will not let it go once you get it. The music can be pretty much enjoyed though not as crisp and clear as a Sony or Audio Technica (I have pretty much used both of these) but it is totally enjoyable with good amount of bass. There are two problems, first the connectivity is lost if you change the room and the sets are not at all useful for calling, there is a noise and sound too is very low.

  Just got it yesterday. My first impression is , its a decent product for this price . U cant compare it to other expensive brands out there. The sound quality is good ,if not great. The only problem anyone would face is , how it fits into the ear. It doesn't fit correctly to the ears, mine is little big for my ears. But still after a couple of adjustmens it can be corrected. Overal its a good product, but not the best.

  In On word Super TWS Earbuds. All frequency ranges(tweter, Midrange, Bass) available. You can hear every instrument sound separately with every detail. Bass production is like hearing a 12 inch JBL woofer due to 13mm driver.I have used it for 8 hours with 50% discharge. It will give you 20 hours playback per 1 exit from case.Black version is of mat rubber finish. Easily connect/disconnect on entry/exit. to/from case.Type-C Interface,  Case finish is very nice, magnet based case with Led battery level indicator (25,50,75,100%). Not for long time music listening at a stretch due to rich bass. Range 10M tested, easily connect/disconnect on leaving /entering bluetooth range.

  N. B. The following pros and cons are considering the price point of 1k.Pros:1) Has auto-pair2) Good battery backup (20hrs including case)3) Type C charging port.4) 14 mm drivers provide really good sound quality with punch bass.5) Small and light weight case with textured finish.6) Somewhat water resistant.7) Good built quality.Cons:1) Audio isn't balanced between left and right properly. Sometimes volume of left earpiece is slightly more than right.2) To my medium sized ear, the fit isn't good. Falls off after some time, and if I press it hard inside my ears, it starts hurting after a little while.3) Connectivity drops if you leave to the next room.4) Sometimes it randomly disconnects and then reconnects again.5) Sometimes any of the earphone may not start charging or disconnect from your device after putting it back in m inside its case, due to a loose connector. Try Adjusting the earphone inside the case manually until it connects to the pin properly and starts chargingConclusion: If you really can't afford more than 1k then buy a neckband style earphone instead, don't go with TWS. Or else pay a little extra and buy a higher end TWS earphone.

  Hey everyone! I figured someone has to go and do a review, these are my quick observations immediately after I open and use it for some time. I‚Äôll be going over each item!1) Earbuds- Their make is cheap, nonetheless your ears pain very quickly with higher volume. You could see that the plastics aren‚Äôt well finished, and look kinda not in shape when you wear them!2) Charging Case- plastic again! Certainly not the AirPods we all wanna have but the ones that we end up satisfying ourselves kinda Case. Looks big and will surely have its effect with Jean pockets and may even break in certain scenarios kinda case.3) Packaging- The representation is very poor, cheap one time usable non- biodegradable plastics that are banned in my state TN and has got no QR codes or sorts saying that they‚Äôre biodegradable and truth be told I haven‚Äôt seen one such in an electronic box packaging for a long time.4) Warranty- The company has mentioned it as 1 year in the box but I don‚Äôt see any warranty cards or stuff related to that of any sorts.5) Micro USB- boringggg!CONCLUSION- I am giving it 3 stars for the price they‚Äôve brought it to us which is cool, I paid ‚Çπ899 which is a lightning deal and MRP. ‚Çπ2000.My opinion- I‚Äôm returning them saying they aren‚Äôt fine because it pains Listening music and the EarPods also has a manufacturing defect like there‚Äôs a smudge in the plastic moulded, and overall I‚Äôm not happy that they‚Äôre throwing whatever they could to us Indians for cheaper price. There‚Äôs a standard for tech in INDIA, I hope so! ;)PS. Pictures attached, I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre rotated, Sorry and have a nice day! :)

    Poor Build and No Customer Support are a let-down
  
","









  
  
    
  The product, which is otherwise promising, is let down by a poor build: and I mean VERY poor. The silver coating on the base of each pod and on the buttons comes off very quickly. The black paint/tape/whatever it is is quite uneven too. I had read a review on Amazon saying that the way the pods fit in the case is strange.... and that they have a new scratch on them every time you pull them out. I decided to overlook this because I just needed a cheap pair of pods to listen to audiobooks on the go, and didn't really care much about their fit and finish.However, after two weeks, the right pod, which was already tight, well..... I'll let the pictures say it for you.I sent a message to pTron through their website, and they responded quite quickly, asking for more specifics about the problem. I sent them two messages, along with these pictures. It's been almost two weeks now, and there is NO RESPONSE! I've been trying to contact them for a while, but they don't respond.It's a cheap pair of TWS earpods/buds. That's great, but such abysmally poor quality makes even the price of 899 to expensive for this. Better buy a cheaper Chinese product f you just need something that can last a few months (this one didn't last two weeks for me).To be fair, on a positive note, the sound quality is not so bad. It isn't great by any means, but for the price, if the product had been good in respect of build and customer support, it would have been worth it.

    Fully functional bluetooth wireless earphones

  After using the product extensively for 2 months, I am revising the rating to 4 from 3. The pain is reduced and battery performance is awesome (continuously used for 6.5 hours on international flight). No five star because of (a) poor/no noise cancellation - can‚Äôt really expect NC at this price (b) Average sound quality*******I have been using these for past 1 week now. Here are pros & cons -Pros -1. At Rs 899, its a steal. You can't find another pair of wireless earphones at this price.2. Amazingly smooth connection and pairing. It takes less than 2 sec for the earphones to connect with each other and then pair with mobile.3. Good battery life - so far I have used it continuously for 3 hours. The case provides additional power. I have been using it for 4 to 5 hours every day.4. Good form factor of the casing and the in-casing snap-on charging mechanism5. Fitment is perfect. I have done cycling, jogging and dancing with these on my ears - and they remain snugly fitted without any problem.Cons -1. Sound quality is pretty average for music. If you are music aficionado then these are not for you. But if you just listen to music, not sound quality conscious, then they are okay. For calls, its okay. The mic is a bit patchy, especially if you move around the phone even within the range.2. BLE range is very short, gets disconnected or becomes patchy beyond 6 mt3. Ears start to pain after couple of hour's usage. The earpieces could have been slightly more comfortable. But then its only a Rs 899 earphone4. Form factor - slightly longer (awkwardly longer actually) outside the ear. If you have a small face then it stands out!I would have given 4 star but giving 3 because of the pain in the ear after prolonged usage and not-so-great sound quality. If you have never used wireless earphones and want to try it out, at Rs 899/- nothing comes close.

  Been using them since the 3 or 4 months. Connection is fast. Pairing is also fast. Battery life is just superb.. They keep going on and on. A very big problem though is that the left side is sensitive to cutting out the connection. If you put your hand across the left side while you're using the headphones. But the moment you move your hand out of the way. Then there's no problem. Other than that. They're just perfect. A small niggle if you ask me. For the price. They're really great

  To keep this review really short, don't waste your hard earned money on this unreliable product for following reasons:-1. Pathetic build quality, you take it out of your ear to learn it's broken already (see the pics)2. Mic stopped working only after Amazon return date is over.3. Worst customer service ever (chasing simce more than 3 months and yet no solution)I've not only lost money on this pathetic product but on courier charges for sending this product from Mumbai to Hyderabad due to only one service centre.So if you still want to buy it looking for this price point trap, go ahead buy it if you stay somewhere around its service centre in Hyderabad because that's the place you'll be visiting when you learn about faulty and faltu product.

  Not a good buy and is not the best in quality. Not user friendly because you need to switch on each earplug independently and it gets discharged from 100% to switch off in like ~2.5 hours. Not very useful when you have online meetings most of the time. Also, it some times automatically starts surround sound effects and after a few seconds stops it. Annoying and distracting because of it. It died on me 2 times during my calls in the same day. Not happy.Another problem is, you can connect it with only one device at once.

  ¬†Both pods some times doesn't responds together.pTron Bassbuds lite is quite good in light weight ears buds. It has 10mm driver which provides a great bass for music. Bluetooth connectivity is normal upto 10metres. Sound quality is clear over call too. Mic is too sensitive that it captures the background sounds and highlights is too much so on call it disturbs the other person who's listening. I give ut 4star but 1 more star added for its charging case it's very durable and handy with matte finish and provide 3+cycles to charge buds. Ut takes less than 1hr to get fully charged from 0%(including case).battery backup is quite good. In my case i used it for 6hr+ in 50%volume watching videos. Really appreciate the design it completely fixes in ear and after too many jaults it dosent displaces from the position. Buds are lightweight so it doesn't feels it is inEar.To Operate you need to turn on both buds and wait for 5sec to get both buds paired. Then connect to phones bluetooth and done. It also have auto poweroff feature when you puts buds back in case it automatically turns off the buds and starts charging.It requires 1A/5V charger. If you put higher one it will start heating up so be careful regarding charger

    Poor built quality, extremely poor customer service

  Performance is Quite good. But the built quality is extremely poor. A part of ear bud got stuck inside of the charging port when I removed the ear bud for very second time. Extremely poor built quality and you can feel it the moment you touch it.And no instructions on warranty claimTheir customer care number is always unattended. After 20 day long email exchanges they offered me to replace it if I courier the product to their warehouse with my money. After that they didn't reply for my emails for a week. Then they told they will send a replacement soon.So after a month of sending my product back , I got a courier from them with a different type of wireless headphones. I found the price is same is the original one, but absolutely uncomfortable and poor sound quality.So now , after 4 months of purchase , I could use the headphone only for 2 days , spend extra money for courier, and have a different product with poor performance on my hand!!New one has poor sound quality , fragile bluetooth connectivity , and non existent noise cancellation

  It's INR 999 folks. Stop looking for airpods like features.I bought them for the purpose of watching tv late at night to avoid disturbing the people sleeping around me. Serves that purpose well.The playback time is impressive, considering the price. Approx 5hrs per charge. The charging case can recharge the ear buds 4 times max on a single charge. At this price those are a definite plus. In ear comfort is good. Never hurt after prolonged use.Fast forward a few months. The only thing that works is the charging case. Both ear phones have stopped charging. Not sure where to go for warranty.

  Attending Meetings using Wired Headphones for Work For Home was becoming a pain. So I finally decided to purchase  wireless Bluetooth headphone.The delivery from Amazon was quick despite the covid transport issues and the packaging from the seller was very well knit. The PTron headphones have seamless connectivity with any device they are paired with and offer clean audio with no disruption for a longer period thanks to the low power consumption. This has made  attending long audio conference meetings smoother for me in last few days.The PTron Bassbuds also offer hand free calls with good voice quality which has helped make my phone calls quite easier with my parents who are currently stranded in other city due to a pandemic. The Charge on go case makes charging quite easier and so far I have been able to fully charge it in 90minutes with around 6-7 hours of talk timeOverall the product has been very handy and useful .

  I have been using the product for last 10 days and I must say its awesome.So when i use it for music its 10 out of 10. As the bass and play is good with one or both the buds connected. But when you are traveling and need to use one for safer side as you can't hear anything apart from the music you play.This becomes bad when you are on call. The person at the other end can even hear every noise in the background. So for calling i would say 5 out of 10.Battery backup is good.Charge once and last a decent amount. For people looking for more than 4-5 hrs of battery can look for other product.Other issue i had was though i love everything about the product the ear bud fitting is quite irregular for me as if I smile, the product falls off.  So i have to keep a straight face to use it.

  I didn't expect much when I bought these cz the price was less but these came out amazing. Really good sound, i hear pop songs so the bass was good too. Volume is really good. The case is matte and looks really good. Only thing lacking is battery life, if you only listen songs then it will last you 4 hours and if you attend a lot of calls with songs then 3 hours. For this you can use one bud at a time and keep other in the pod for charging and replace when the battery in other pod dies.

  Its been now more than 2 months and I want to be very specific about my review.Considering the price the buds are good, but the quality of the product is not consistent.1st purchase received damaged product as 1 ear bud was not at all working. So as the policy i received a replacement from the seller.Now the ear buds were working fine but then after almost 2 months of use (actually less than 2 months) again right ear bud stopped working. Now since it passed the 10 days replacement policy of Amazon i had to contact the company for warranty.Its been more than 20 days and there is no response from the company.They have a so called customer care number, but whenever you call that number its always busy.After a long thought I personally came with an understanding that if we need a after sale service then go with the reputed brand, i know they are expensive than these, but at least you have a guaranty  that you are getting post sales service.Again its the individuals choice what to and what not to buy, but if anyone looking for a suggestion then mine would be straight, buy only reputed company products.

  I bought PTron Bassbuds Lite couple of days back and I am extremely satisfied with the product.First thing one watches while buying earphones or headphones is the sound quality of the product and after using extensively PTron Bassbuds Lite, I can assure you that these buds doesn‚Äôt disappoint you in this area. The sound is decent with good bass, decent voice and instrument separation and noise reduction.Other thing one looks for while buying a Bluetooth earphones or headphones is the battery backup. With 50mAh Li-Polymer Battery (each earbud), it easily lasted for more than 5 hours with extensive calling and music listening. This is more than the competitors in this and the higher price range are. In addition, the case comes with 400mAh battery; this gives you almost 4 cycles of full charging of Bassbuds Lite. The voice quality during the calls was clear and excellent at both the ends.Detailed Review:Sound: As said above, it gives a nice experience of listening music with distortion free bass from different genres.Design: I bought a black colour variant and matt finish look of the Bassbuds Lite impressed me in the given price range. It is light in weight and easy to carry with case.Battery: The 50mAh Li-Polymer Battery (each earbud and 400mAh Charging cum Carrying Case astonished me with the battery backup at heavy usage.Connectivity: The connectivity is good and fast and I have not faced any issues with the connectivity.Calling: With noise reduction and an inbuilt microphone, Bassbuds Lite give a astound experience while callingFit: It comes in a size that can be easily fitted in any ear perfectly. In addition, it comes with different sets of rubber buds to fit in properly with the shape of your ears.At the price point, it is good value for money. I will definitely recommend it to others.

  After testing it for 3 days i'd came up with a very conclusive review. There are 4 factor which we expect most in any buds is battery backup, comfort fit, sound quality and bass. So if we look at its fit the earbuds get fit so nicely that it'll block noise from surround. The sound quality is good but not great and that's what you get at this price point.  Sometimes it feels noisy and distorted during calls but that's okay. The bass is very great. Ans this product easily last 4 hours per charge and you can charge 4 times from its given box. Lastly i would conclude that , at this price point the product is perfect. Else who knows how much will it last long.

  This is my second purchase.Best suitable for kid's attending online classes.Not for listening to music. No bass.Not for talking as the microphone is of very low quality. The listener at the receiving end hears it with a very hollow undertone.The earphone cushions are of cheap plastic like a balloon material. one got torn while changing. Removing and changing the cushion is cumbersome. Needs effort.However It gives an elegant look while wearing.The fitting into the ear canal is perfect. Doesn't fall when you choose the right size of the cushion.Charging case is very cute with different LED color lights for charging  and and while in use.Tap gestures on the earphones comes handy and funtion well.It serves my purpose to the fullest with a real value for the money!!

  If you want a basic pair of truly wireless stereo headphones, these are perfect. The pairing was straight forward and sound quality is satisfactory. Keep in mind that these are very basic earphones and do not provide the quality that is even remotely comparable to that of B&O, Sennheiser or Sony. But for the price they are asking, I could not fault them.Positives:+ Cheap+ Easy pairing+ Left and Right are in perfect sync.+ No drops so far.+ Decent battery life+ Decent sound quality.+ Enough loudness+ ComfortableNegetives:- Flimsy- The chrome garnish is actually paint and will fade away in a week revealing the white plastic underneath- The mircophone is too weak.

    Good for music not for calls

  I am writing this review after using it for 2 months. Sound and Bass quality is good while you listen to music. For calls, you can hear the sound what other person is taking but I often hear complaints from other side that they can't hear me clearly. So the mic is not very good. There is no noise cancellation. Absolutely disappointed with noise cancellation. If you are walking outside and using your patron bass buds to talk to another person....then there is no way you or the other person can hear you. You will hear complaints from other side that you are not audible. Yes, price is cheaper...but only good for music.

    Awesome Bassbuds

  These in-ear bass buds are of very high quality and premium make and are from well known PTron Brand.  I have used many of the PTron Products and this one just sounds great. This has great Bluetooth connectivity and a range of coverage.  This device is of premium make and surely takes advantage of price point. Battery backup is awesome and sound quality is brilliant. This also comes with a 1-year warranty, Bang On. Very handy and durable. Very much satisfied with the quality and build of the product and as well, great value for money. Loving this. Highly Recommended.

  The built quality is pretty decent. Sound levels are good enough for an entry level blutooth earphones.Bass is somewhat at a mediocre level. The treble levels are more boosted in as compared.But the sound output is pretty clear.Tried different platforms like youtube, netflix,wync and few more..the better the quality of audio or video at these platform the better these earphones sound.Battery levels are surprising

  This product is ok and easy to connect.Sound and bass is not that great but it's good for that cost.After taking from charger box it takes approximately 7-10 sec to connect paired device.Bit bigger than airpods.Don't expect too much for that price.Ok to use.Not falling of from my ears, if it falls go with different buds sizes which are available inside that package.Note: Don't expect that good bass from this product.

  Updating my review after using it for one and half months:1) Product has rubberized texture which gives it the premium feel2) Battery backup degraded very fast, now having to charge the case after every 1 cycle.3) Lots of background noise if you want to attend meetings using this.4) Lots of disconnection issues, every now and then you will be keep switching off and on to get it working.I am just trying now to get rid of this product now.

  Bought these TWS Earbuds and so far this is what I think of it,Battery life is great..I charged it 5 days ago when I received it..still has like 40% charge left.Sound quality is good.Bluetooth connectivity is something which is lagging a bit, need to use it more to see how it goes or else it's fine.Bass quality is pretty good too.Noise cancellation is best.Built is compact and nice & they are super comfortableOverall I will say it's an awesome product.

  I just wanted to try the TWS System, and didn't wanted to invest thousands without knowing it works for me or not.I Didn't have any Expectations with these.And when I Unboxed them, although I Loved the Green Color, I felt the Plastic Quality was just Average at best.Then, I paired it Put it in the Ears, and the Computer sound of It Being Paired was Pathetic, It Dipped my Expectations even more.Then, as I Played a Track, I was FLABERGASTED..So Surprised, The Audio Quality is just Mind Boggling.I started Head dancing out of Joy.Using it since then Regularly, found Battery life to be Pretty Good as Well.Hats off To PTron for providing something like this at this Price.If you Have only this much to spend, Look no Further.

  There are a few genuises who like to compare this with apple's airpods which are only 14 grand pricier than this one item, ignoring those geniuses you will find this item fits your needs and purposes. This one seems like a rip-off of apple product but the price difference does matter.1. it is true I felt a bit pain in the ear after some time of listening music at high volume, but are you sure it ownt happned on apple airpods, that is the nature of in ear hearing.2. Cheap plastic: well plastic is plastic and it is used because it is cheap. And is there any expensive plastic ?? And even if it is there do I care ?? well no as long as the build quality is great do I need to care ?? the build quality is very good though.3. The angle of speaker placement is probably best, dont know if this is also a rip off from apple product.4. Overall very good finish  that makes it look like a branded item and not like a cheap chinese product.

  ¬†While ordering earphones (TWS), I was really skeptikal about which ones to order and ended up ordering ptronn Bassbuds lite. They are super stylish and compact. They come with a micro USB charging cable. The battery life is also very long lasting , I am using it continuously now for 3 days and charged it just ones so you can just forget about charging it and use it freely.It is also light weight, which is good if you want to carry it around. It offers good noise cancellation for this price point. The bluetooth connectivity is also fast, as soon as I take it out of the case, it gets connected. I would suggest everyone to go for it if you are looking for a budget friendly TWS.

  Firstly i ordered this product seeing lot many reviews and purchases as i was looking for a wireless ear buds.1. The charging cable is not fitting into the pin. Very bad experience with it.2. The sound quality is bit upsetting as i expected a smooth and loud bass. But its just giving a sharp tincture kind of sound which is although loud with volume increase but the bass beats feel is missing. Feels like the sound is coming from somwhere far. Not exact feel into the ears which shud ideally a ear phone  is meant for.3. The box is so delicate. I thought its a magnet type of closing box but its like a pencil box.But the box looks good.4. Ear buds are little bit falling off after some time.5. Otherwise the making and all are good and budget friendly.(Do not compare with any other brands as each one has its own making and features).6. Finally just pick it according to your requirement.

  So I'm super impressed!! I received these today and have been totally impressed by the ptron buds so far. I've been listening for 2 hours so far and this is my immediate feedback. 1. The charging case is way smaller 2. The actual earpieces are way smaller 3. The overall fidelity is robust & have a great baseline through to treble range. 4. I can easily hear the person with whom I'm speaking when making phone calls and the person with whom I'm speaking said they could hear me well too. 5. Overall packaging presentation as a first impression was great. 6. Pairing with my phone was very easy. 7. I've been listening for 2 hours so far and the battery level has remained at a high level which suggests their claim of up to 14 hours charge seems to be right! So first impressions are a great experience and renews my faith in ptron.

  For daily use and phone calls it's good earbuds. Comes in decent cost as well and with matt finish.Pros1. Good matt finish and good in terms of looks and finishing.2. Nice sound quality and phone call sound.3. Once paired with your phone it will automatically connects whenever u start next time.4. Automatically starts once u remove earbuds from case and paires.5. Once charged can work for 8-10 hours in idle time.Cons1. Noise cancellation is not upto mark.2. Plastic material so there is always chance to broke if it's drop from certain height.3. Will pain in ears if it's wore for too long.4. The pairing remain good at distance of 2-3 meters of phone and not beyond that.My suggestion is to wear one earbud at a time and not more than 2-3 hours continuously. Wear both together only if u wanna see movie.

  The earpods I received were in immaculate condition and their finishing too was exceptionally good. They pair well with my old Samsung phone too. The only drawback is that the opposite person isn't able to hear me clearly through the it's microphones and if I cup my hands over it, the opposite person hears an echo.The microphones should have been positioned in the front instead of the sides. Otherwise it's a very nice pair of earpods.

  Look it's good. It is a good product but if you compare it with a 4000 or like some dumb people 24000 rupees wireless earbuds then you might complain a lot. Yes, you can get a better sounding wired earphone in this price but if you want a truely wireless earbud within this price range then you can definitely check it out. As I said the sound quality is not mindblowing but except that the other features are really good. I've been using this for couple of days and in my case the bluetooth connection,microphone and the call quality was really nice. So if you know that a 1000 rupees product should never be compared to a 5000 rs. product then you can buy this with no hesitation.

  While everything seems to be okay - the right earbud would not charge. Returned it after 3 days.Too many people have complained about it.

Its auto connect feature when taking out of the charging case and auto power off when put into charging case save a lot of time.

  An edit after a month of usage:The left hand side of the earphone started non-functioning, and when I contacted one of the customer service from Harman, they suggested me to drop the product at nearest Collection Point. I did submit it on Aug 12th, but it has been around more than 1 month, they have not returned my prodcuct.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, COLLECTION POINT WILL TAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN WARRANTY AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RETURN IT WITHIN MONTHS STATING THAT IT IS NOT AVAILABLE AT OUR WEARHOUSE.WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AT HARMAN. DEGRADING MY RATING TO POOR FOR THIS PRODUCT.An edit after 10 days of its usage:1. I observed one great feature which I have not been able to feel within 02 days of its arrival. It is this earphone's build quality or we can say the engineering behind a pseudo active noise cancellation. When you put this earphone, it is adjusted so beautifully that you simply forget the noise of the outer world, and you can seemlessly enjoy the music. It is not due to an inbuilt active noise cancellation, it is due to its built feature being so carefully crafted.2. The battery life after 10 days of usage has not perfomed as per the data revealed by JBL. As per my usage over the past 10 days, it is not upto the mark.After 02 days of using this product, we can say it is quite a normal product from JBL. When we are investing 4k onto a product, we are expecting some big to come, but no, it is quite a decent one from JBL stock plies.1. JBL‚Äôs signature Pure Bass sound: It is not up to the mark. But we can say here it has a very balanced Bass. People who are used to listen songs at a balanced bass, it is good for them,2. 17 Hours of Playtime: It needs more time to test this feature. We could not comment on this feature just by using it for 02 days.3. Connectivity: It is really great in terms of connectivity with Bluetooth 5.0 enabled devices. And in addition to this, its auto sync feature really makes a difference in handling and using this device fora long run.4. It is lightweight and comfortable. But its case seems to be bigger as compared to our pocket sizes.At last, It is a decent product from JBL and we can give it a try if we are having 4k to invest, otherwise, there are so much options available at 2k.Signing off.------------

    After usage for two days
  
","









  
  
    
  After a usage of two days am happy with this product so much.If you are true music lover go for this am sure.I had an experience with realme buds too but JBL had an edge over that and don't fall for those gimmick advertisement campaigns from other brands low latency, instant pairup and all.I played cod with this for 2 days I didn't feel any lag of sound while playing the game.Battery backup is a major point here. You don't get it on realme and most importantly music the variation of tracks is clearly visible on left and right that you cannot able to see on those brands.These companies like sony,JBL,bose are dedicated for sound composure and you can able to visible see the difference from other products from these products.Cons: 1) no type c ( but that is not an issue for me)If you are music lover and you want to feel extra bass then surely I will say you to go for this ( this is budget segment) if budget is not a problem go for sony Wf Xb700

    Good earbuds with Great Music Throughput
  
","









  
  
    
  I received these earbuds with in 2 days of ordering them. The packaging was nice which is norm for orders fulfilled by amazon.Following are my observation as per my brief usage:Pros:1) Ear buds are light weight you won't face any issues after hours of working.2) For me pairing with Phone was instant . I don't need to press any button at all.3) Both ear buds got paired as soon as I take them out of case.4) Music throughput was great. Sound does not get distorted even at full volume. Bass is at par with my Sony Extra bass earphone.5) Bluetooth range was satisfactory for me .(It got disconnected after 15-20 feet distance).6) Used for calls from home, sound was crisp and clear to other person. Yet to see how it works in crowded area which is not possible given the current circumstances.7) Case gets charged quickly .Cons:1) Rubber buds provided are of poor quality . Didn't justify Rs 4k price one is pairing.2) These does not seems to be water proof. Nothing mentioned about it in user manual i received. If you want it for gym and jogging check twice

Although I have not used it for making calls and am returning it within 24 hours of receipt, I would like to warn other potential customers that the seller does NOT offer a refund but only replacement.I have had to get with Amazon Customer care and the lady was very helpful.

Press earbud buttons 4-5 times in quick succession, repeat this 2-3 times,then you will see, Earbuds automatically gets turnoff.Means your earbud is reset. now turn it on. you will see both earbuds automatically gets connected to each other, then left earbuds light turn in to blue color.

  Hi All, I received this product on 7/13. The audio quality is really Good but not much of bass effect as Sony. All is say is worth for money without much thought you can go for it with reasonable price. The sound quality varies when you connect to phone and laptop. Currently, I'm using OnePlus 7T but the sound quality is okay when checked but when connected to laptop and checked the sound quality is awesome you can feel the bass effect. The packing was really good by Amazon as always and delivery was on times as per the commitment.Bass effect: 8/10Noise cancellation: No, you will still be able to listen to outside noiseComfortable: Yes, you need to change  the earbud as per your comfortOverall: 8/10.

  I would rate this product 0 stars if it was possible. This is easily one of the worst products I have ever purchased. It was faulty the first day I bought it. Too many unnecessary features packed into a tiny device which does not even work properly. After a couple days, one of the earphones stopped working completely. After trying to get in contact with the JBL team for what felt like years. they finally agreed to give me a replacement. I sent it to the service centre and had to wait around 20 days even though it was promised that I would get a replacement within 10 days. When I received the new product it worked fine for about 5 hours until it started showing the same problems that my previous one had shown. Absolutely disgusting. The voice continuously comes blurry, the bluetooth connection keeps disconnecting, they keep falling out of the ears and have many many other faults. The product also continues not to work in one ear. I will never purchase anything from JBL again and know not to. They charge absolutely way too much for this waste of money and time. Do not buy this product. It will definitely disappoint. Good job JBL, for cheating me and wasting my money üëçüèª

  I bought two of these. One for my Dad and one for myself. We both have different requirements and been using it for two weeks.- Our budget was 5k and this fit perfectly in that- Used extensively for calls, good clarity. Person on the other end can hear without any noise.- Even though these are not noise canceling, you cannot hear the background noise because of the inbuilt quality.- We both are music fans and range varies from classic rock to techno. The music on this is amazing. You can literally hear every beat. JBL is known for its bass clarity and they have done a good job with these earpods.- With full battery charge, this lasts for about 4 to 4.5hrs.- 2 sets bought and no complaints so far.

  As expected from Harman Kardon, with C105TWS you get mind blowing sound quality (a tad better on the lower end of the frequency). But audiophiles aren't gonna be super impressed though, considering the price range at which it's available. The build quality is superb when compared to the other TWS available at this range, and carries the JBL logo. The ear buds in itself easily lasts for over 4hrs on high volume. The charging case comes to your rescue by providing full charge to the buds just over two times. The buds are comfortable and ergonomic and can sustain low to medium workouts without falling off your ear. Overall highly recommended for casual listeners and ones handling tons of voice calls in a day.

  Bought them expecting a good quality because of JBL and they were on a 50% sale (gimmick, I bought them at Rs. 4000+ around the current regular price). Been using these for 2 months now.  I have a couple of Bluetooth headphones, Sony WH-1000XM3 (over-the-ear), Otium Beats (in-ear, Bluetooth, but wire-connected)  and this one was to replace my in-ear, button, wireless Bluetooth headphone that I lost in a water accident and used for outdoor activities.Pros:1. Slick design: Charger and headphones.2. Great in-ear fit. Never fell off.3. Audio quality pretty decent; not great, but can't complain.Cons:1. For both mobile and what's app calls, adds a voice delay from 2-14 seconds. This is extremely inconvenient. And this is not a phone problem as my other headsets and direct phone speaker/earpiece work fine with no delay additions when I immediately switch to them.2.Connection with the phone drops intermittently and reconnects  after 3-4 seconds for no reason3. When I am riding cycle, I keep the headphone only in the left ear, so I can hear the traffic.  If I keep the phone in my short's right pocket, it will start dropping the connection frequently. I have to keep it in the left pocket.4. This is more of an annoyance than a problem:  when you take them out of the charger they are automatically switched on and connect to the previously connected device.5. I have seen if there's wind it will stop dropping connection if phone and headsets are stationary.

  I was expecting better sound quality. There is no bass at all. Noise cancellation is not good. There is a constant sound which is really irritating. Well it's a waste of money completely Bad Buy. There is no volume key.so overall sound quality is 0 out 10 stars. My request not to buy this product at all. It would be a waste of money

  I've only just received this product and tried for few hours . it's not as good as i expected it to be but still a great choice to go for buds under this price range. Buds are light weight though I had to change the earbuds tips from my previous earphones for better hold in my ears .Built quality is great by the wayI just brought it for a change anyways so if you're into heavy bass n stuff these aren't for youI still have to check if battery life is as long as it's said to be so I'll update that later

  This is my first ever wireless earphones. I always assumed that wireless reduces quality so never picked up one. But lately seen the tws fad and wanted to try and got one.Pro: The product is solidly built. Decent bass, you won't disappoint. It struggled in high's department imo. Mids and lows doesn't disappoint.Cons: The fit is irritating (may be because its my first time tws usage or not).Comes with Micro usb port. (Its not a huge deal though)Summary: overall decent performance. But it's not a bang for buck. There's a reason Jbl has higher priced products. I'll update review  after  more usage.PS: I purchased this device for convenience. I have excellent over ear and in ear wired ear phones.  If you are just trying out tws earphones pick some low cost ones.

But unfortunately the product was defective the battery was not working properly. I charged it to 100% but after 10 min of use, charge reduce to 20%.It may be happened in my case only, u might not get defective one.But as far as over-all review is concerned regarding bass and all, It has a normal decent bass If those who like extra bass then pls don't buys it. Connectivity is simple. Look is decent, weight is really light, case and everything belongs to the eardopes was good.In my opinion If u r investing 1800/- then I recommend u to pay 400-500 hundred extra and buys BOAT EARDOPES 441. These product is far better than this 171.Hope this review will help you to buy.

  On My Phone Output to these earphones is  AAC so audio is a good deal .1. Each Bud Can be used Separately. Light weight and good fit and also compact size. Range ~ 10M2.Pairing is fast.3. Gaming(WCC3,pubg,fortnite) audio/video out of sync by a fraction of seconds (this is happening even with high end tws ) so can't judge them here.4. Audio/Video Sync on Sonyliv,Hotstar,Prime,Netflix,Youtube,Zee5 is bang on (if you are facing trouble with this please exchange )5. Call Quality indoors is Really good , outside on roads is okay but does well for most of the times .6. There are physical buttons on either side which allows you to change tracks,call your voice assistant,attend calls which is pretty good but at times while outdoors /running its difficult to press the buttons.7. Bass is Good8. If you are facing issue with pain in the ears or irritating make sure you put on the correct fits(comes with small,med,large)9. There is no particular noise cancelling as such (anyways you should not expect them in around 2k ) however on full volume i could barely hear anything both indoors/outdoors .10. if you face issues with one bud or something during connecting i would suggest you to reset them by long pressing for 8-10 secs on either of the buds to fix.OverallMust Buy if you are on budget (2k or less) and don't want to compromise on quality and sound.

  I've used them for a month before posting these reviewsPROS:1. Sound Quality is very good, as considered these are by boat2. Bass is also good according to the size of drivers given3. Only buds gives 3-4 hrs of continuous usage backup on mobile, with case it gives 10-11 hrs of backup.4. Connectivity is good and superfast, Single to double transition is also very easy and fast.5. Unless there is a wall or any large metal barrier in between, range is also good.CONS:1. MAJOR Con is its NOISE CANCELLATION,While on Call other person can hear TV sound from another room,Same goes while Video Recording.2. It is not good for Online meetings as audio lags in every 3-4 secs (on laptop), same with pc gaming3. Buds gives battery life of 2.5 hrs while using on pc.I've bought it for 1800 when it launched, It has reduced Price to 1500 in just one month üò§BONUS: I've tried to connect each buds with 2 seperate mobiles at the same time, and it WORKED, Just need to think a little bit.

No doubt it may even break if slightly malhandled.2. The Light Rose variant of this items gets dirty very soon and small scratches becomes lot more evident in this color3. Problems do arises when both ear pods are not taken out of the case at the same time. In such scenarios the pod that is taken out later has to be manually connected at times.4.

Now about this product looks wise this product is amazing. I was confused between blue or black buds after that I go for common colour black really happy for my decision when I received this it‚Äôs looks superb and very light weight so looks and quality wise 5/5After using this for last 3 days battery is good  as per mentioned 3 hours with songs and with charge case almost 12 hours so battery wise 4/5.Calling functions are good works well both side good you just speak loud sometimes but I think is normal in this type of earbuds. So in calling 4/5.But now come to music where I little disappointed for this product. Sound is clear ( not crystal clear) but bass is normal not high bass which I expected from boat product but I disappointed and volume is not much full of high average volume ( decent volume) may be some one not like this level of volume so for not who like higher volume and yes noise cancelling is good. So for music 3/5.overall nice product in this price range little bit disappointed in sound otherwise product is good. Overall ratings 4/5.

  Sound quality is great . No issues with that but the noise cancellation is so much that even if a person sitting in the same room speaks., You won't be able to hear him/her.Battery is very good compared to other air pods and ear pods.  Bass quality could have been better as comparison with realme air pods the white ones. Overall good product . With a nice selection of colours . Also while buying from an Indian or non-chinese brand we expect the product to be produced, developed, made all and everything to be in India or anywhere except China.

The manual shows detailed steps and procedures.The product is a great deal.The noise cancellation is great even on low volumeBass quality js great toothe manual has common problems also solvedThe process to start pairing:1. Charge the case with the buds inside for about an hour2. open the case, there will be 2 colours - red and yellow blinking.3. open your phonw settings and pair after turning on the bluetooth.The product comes with only one pod charged i.e. rightthe box contains the pods with case, charging wire, 2 sets of ear pieces (2 sizes) apart from the ones on the pods, user manual and warranty card

    Disappointed with the performance considering the price.

  Review after one week of usage of the ""AIRDOPES 171""The sound quality is average to good and can be much better when compared to other products available in the market. To BASS lovers, the product doesn't suit the price tag it displays, and yet boAt always promotes their products as ""high-quality bass"". The airdopes 171 have disappointed me when it comes to the bass section. The connectivity range is a bit low, it disconnects when one goes to another room taking the airdopes away from the phone. This is worrying considering the price, it utters for only 4-7 meters. The airdopes are light in weight and are hanging on to ears perfectly and one can trust that these do not fall off our ears although considering its little size. Perfect for working out and other outdoor activities. The airdopes size is quite big and it may fit in the ear perfectly but for some people, it may be too big and maybe a problem when adjusting in the ears when putting on the device. I found it big to my ears and I always had to readjust my airdopes from time to time. Coming to the mic functionality, the mic is the worst part of the device. Even some cheap wired earphones would do better than these airdopes 171 and this is a major issue boAt should consider before releasing products. During a call, the other person will have to listen to our carefully due to the poor mic system and this is a big turn off.Finally, comparing the price and the performance,1799 for an average product and is a big thumbs down as it has every aspect to improve on. The price is incredibly high and it only works as a moderate product like any other cheap wired earphones available in the market. I've to tell you that my wired Sennheiser CX 275s works more, gives more sound quality and bass than these airdopes 171. The product is not worth the money in final words.

  Really good !I am reviewing this product after using it for almost a month now, no issues yet.Have attached all types of images possible.A charging cable comes along with it as well, but it is very small in length.I had read a lot of reviews and most of them were good but most of them suggested that the bass is not good but i personally feel that the bass is pretty well.The battery life is also good. There are different sized tips.In this rate this is one of the best products.Highly recommended!As soon as it is removed from the case green loght turns on.

  The most important thing is it's quality. The sound,The Bass , The audio quality is just amazing. Price is pretty reasonable. Making this perfect to buy. It can connect to almost all your devices. I have an alexa and boAt and Alexa work pretty well.  crystal mode, voice assistant are good( mostly you won't use them both) But still great. One more important thing is, The newer versions of boAt  earbuds come with Lithium batteries for input but this version doesn't because less time on playback  and usage time. But less of a Burden. GREAT, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. AND ALSO GREAT FOR WORKOUT.

  1. I like the earpods charge quickly within 45 minutes through the case with it...and the case charges completely almost 2¬Ω hours .2. And i dislike that sometimes it sound cuts while hearing some online videos.3. Almost sound and bass good.4. One major point of this is that its bluetooth connectivity range is not much longer it maximum is 25 feet.So , these are my reviews i think these are sufficient for a new buyer to fulfil it eagering questions.

I had to charge the case like after only 2 weeks, Plus I have used every single day for like 5 hrs+.The built Quality is Good and the airdops fits perfectly into our ears with causing any disturbance.Finally I like to say that this is one of the best budget airdops a.k.a airpods you can have at this Price..

Connects well with my Google Pixel, Windows laptop & Smart TV. Sound level for the TV felt little low.Liked all the features like multi functional button on the eardopes for skipping tracks, answering calls, etc.One drawback for me is you cannot connect two devices at the same time.

    The best wireless ear pods! Absolutely worth the buy!
  
","









  
  
    
  The Boats Airdopes 171 (Rose Gold) is purely a bundle of joy! These mini-sized fully wireless earpods have everything working in their favour, starting from it's pocket-friendly price and size, to the edgy design and chic hue. Boat delivers amazing sound quality and the noise cancellation is as good as it gets at this price range. The earpods stay in their place and can withstand slight jerks as well. The bass could have certainly been a bit better and the pods are operated using a touch-button instead of fingerprint-sensors but it's hardly something that I can complain of. Overall, this product is a definite buy! I will never stop swooning over the cute size and the warm rose gold tone of these pods! There's a size comparison between Boat Airdopes 441 (Black) vs 171(Rose Gold) in the images to show just how small the 171 are.

  I bought this product on Great Indian Sale at a price of 1499/- .*Build Quality*Build quality is amazing, it gives premium feeling and case and opening lid are strong. Opening lid doesn't open unnecessarily until you open it with hands, which gives safety that eardopes doesn't fell easily from the case.charging Magnet is good, it sticks soo strong.*Charging*They mention that once charged will get 3hours of playback, I tested it and i am getting almost 3 to 4 hours battery life on the eardopes (continuous playback).From 100% - 40% in 4hours approxFrom 40% - 10% in just 10minsFrom 10% - 0% in just 10minsSo a total of 3 to 4 hours playback you will get (Once the eardopes are charged to 100%)They said the charging case will give you 10hours of charging time to eardopes, Yes it is giving.The only drwaback with charging case is we don't know how much charge is left in the case, until we plug into the charging port.*Charging Time*Eardopes - 0% - 100% --> 30 - 40 minsCharging Case - 2hoursOverall experience is good, and i will rate this product 4 out of 5.

Very light weight, build quality is very good, dual tone color, also battery life is too good as compare to price tag. Well fitted in ears, no pain in ears for using long duration calls or video conferencing, voice quality is perfect.But only 1 thing I found negative in thisIt won't connected to more than a device in one time, if you are working on laptop then it only connect with laptop not with your phone. It is only thing i feel cons for this Boat airdopes 171.Else overall product is fantastic.

  Bought these 2 months back, and after a thorough use I'm disappointed a little. You can't use them for a long time as it's not a very snug fit. The main problem is with connectivity and sound. Many times the left earpiece will not work. Then I have to manually turn it on. The sound gets distorted in between watching a movie which is very irritating. The sound keeps fading away in between which is not what I expected. Amazon displays that it provides a discount of 4k but its not that. Its actual price is 1800 only. Sadly I cannot replace it with Amazon now. Better if you spend more on a reliable product.

  if u want to listen only music n experience that true wireless then its worth, else there are issues in mic. Also only one earbud gets connected to laptop.Update as of 21-Sep-20 :Now am able to connect both ear buds to my laptop, not sure how this is working now. MIc quality is better only when you use both earbuds during call.

  I purchased this thinking of the start-up ""Pebble"" brand starting with watches as I remember. They were a good start up and believed in their product quality before purchasing. It was not a bad decision. The packing was great and so was the finish of the product on the first look. They fit perfectly well into ears and are not at all heavy. The finish is smooth and does not hurt even after wearing it a couple of hours I tried on different occasions making telephone calls or listening to music. Pairing is easy and occurs in a jiffy. Telephone calls are heard well by others if both the earphones are connected and a bit of sound loss by mic if only one is connected. Speaker volume and clarity is superb. You have to actually reduce the volume to about 20-30% of the full volume to have adequate loudness unlike others where you have to go even beyond the recommended 50%. For music, the clarity of different tones and instruments is great. The lower frequencies need a little pumping up of the volume to be audible. Hence, if you are a music lover and enjoy having a full range, you may need to have a little higher volumes if it is acceptable but as such for phone calls and watching movies etc. it is a great pair. The surround sound functions perfectly well, makes it a good buy. The warning sounds of the phones being connected or battery being low are a bit annoying and very loud, perhaps the manufacturer can try to look at that and replace it with a pleasant voice with adequate recording controls to avoid clipping of the frequency of the spoken notification. Battery back up is good. On an average listening of about 2 hours of phone calls and 2 hours of music a day, I still have to recharge the batteries after 3 days. It is working well.  Overall, I would say, at this cost, it is a great buy.

  This pair of pods are good effort in copying Apple Airpods. They have tried to provide similar functionalities at 1/10th of Apple airpod's price.I like few functionalities which work flawless. When I take out the pods from the charging case, it automatically connects to the device it was connected previously. But! If I had a phone call, then I have to disconnect and connect again, else it doesnot work if I do a whatsapp call. After a whatsapp call, it has problem in playing voice from media.. like youtube for example. Disconnect and connect, volla, there it goes again.The connectivity with my laptop was awesome, and I enjoyed the MS Teams, Skype Calls through these earphones for a couple of days. Now it has been almost a week, now the calls are choppy.  My colleagues say that I am choppy, and I hear them choppy. Then I shift back to my wired headphones, volla! my calls are perfect again!Anyway, This product can be an excitement for a couple of days, Value for money? I dont know.

  This is my third Bluetooth neckband, I own a House of Marley, a Realme Bud and this one. A brief comparison on some key parameters and a short review of this one.Battery: The Realme does standout, lasts much longer than the other two, charging too is quite fast, the Infinity Glide came fully charged and dropped to 80% with about 60 minutes of usage, at this rate I guess it may last for just about 5-6 hours at the most. Charging is reasonably fast.Comfort: This is pretty light and comfortable, the wires connecting the buds are not as stiff as the realme ones, the original earbuds fit perfectly and caused no pain or discomfort, the band round the neck too is comfortable, better than the Realme and the House of Marley. All three come with extra pairs of buds. Fits well and does not pop out while jogging or walking, the same holds for the other two devices compared as well.Sound quality: The house of Marley was good while it lasted, alas, the Right bud stopped working after two years. The Realme too is good, though I found the highs missing in a few popular songs. The Infinity Glide is just about ok, the bass is present, but I found the highs missing, and some songs, thought the vocals sounded a bit dull (sort of muffled), but tastes differ. House of Marley was the best followed by the Realme, this one would just be ok for me. Both the Realme and the Glide had no noticeable lag when playing videos.Features: The Realme feature of connecting and disconnecting using the magnetic buds was awesome, no such feature exists in  Glide. The Glide though has a small cover to close the USB charging slot, the Realme has no such cover. The Glide has a BT 5.0, while the others don't, I found the connection strong even with a wall in between. The Dual EQ usage was a bit difficult, simultaneous pressing of the two-volume buttons cumbersome and the Bluetooth kept getting disconnected, also the phone had to be reconnected to the earphone each time the earphone was powered on, this I found to be seamless in Realme. The track change is a long press in the Glide, needs time to get used to this as I ended up increasing the volume several times while changing the track. The Glide is supposed to be splash-proof, though I have not tried this.Call quality: Realme beats the other two hands down on this. House of Marley was the worst. If one uses the earphone for calling as a primary purpose, the Realme should be a better option.Looks and Feel: Realme looks premium, followed by the Marley earphone. The Glide has the infinity symbol on the buds flat outer surface, while the Realme does not even sport a logo. I would put Realme on top of the list.Durability: The House of Marley earphones lasted just about two years, the Realme is about three months old, and going strong, need to see how long the Infinity Glide lasts.Verdict: If the difference of 500Rs between the Realme and the Glide is not very significant, I would recommend the Realme. But if 500Rs is a big difference, then the Glide is pretty functional, decent sound and comfort, my only concern would be the battery, 5-6 hours is all that I think it could give on first use, while the Realme gave me 8 hours easily on one charge. I guess the disconnect feature while not in use comes in handy for the Realme.

  Best product in this range ...finally bought this after testing all other similar products like : Realme buds, Sony and OnePlus bullets...bcz quality music is all that I craze for!!I could feel the difference in the sound quality maintained by this product from Infinity..Besides its neckband is very much comfortable and easy to fold and carry anywhere. I have also used it with laptop and there was no problem in connectivity or quality.

  Was a bit skeptical while thinking of buying this since there were not much review online and purchased by seeing just 2 reviews one on amazon and one on youtube and rest by seeing the specs of 12mm driver and EQ mode ,Also this is my first bluetooth earphones purchased and have used sennheiser wired one beforeNow about the earphones1- The plastic quality is good,2- Sound Quality which is the main highlight is much better in my opinion then my friends boat wireless and I am highly satisfied to use it switching from my wired sennheiser because the sound quality for me is not much different and if its about base then this device is much stronger in deep base mode.3- for new users you might feel the volume - button to not feel tacktile compared to Volume+, its because of lower surface area for the Vol- button which is not a problem.4 - comes with 1 year warranty and would like to see how long lasting this device would be for me ..5 - This review I have wrote after using for few minutes of delivery and listening to Li Nas X - Old town Road , Denzel Curry- Ultimate and also will update the review if I find something wrong.

They are getting disconnected with in 5mins when connected to any device. After sale service is pathetic. I‚Äôm struggling to get these set of earphones replaced since last 15 days.

    Talking about audio quality.
  
","









  
  
    
  ** I just wanted to save your time so, pubg people & mic quality people this review ain't for you. This review focuses basically on the audio quality part.So, giving you guys a little background about me, I'm a musician and as you can see in the images I've used two wired headphones alongside this wireless headphone for comparison.Left - Audio Technica CLR 100BKMiddle - Sennheiser CX 213Right - Infinity Glide 120Now I've always chosen Sennheiser basically as they don't color any particular zone of the sonic spectrum; if you're a flat sound lover you basically know what I'm talking about. Also, Audio Technica comes somewhere nearby; just a lil bit of color in the low end to provide that 'oomph' or the thump & subtle reduction of the highs, more of a thumpy festival sound.Now coming to Infinity, this guy doesn't seem to reproduce the high end at all, don't know if I 'burn-in' these earphones hoping the sound quality will improve a bit.I basically wanted a wireless upgrade without causing a hole in my pocket for the rest of the month; so gave this a try.* Well, the extra bass tag is no special, don't be fooledLow - 10/10Mids - 9/10Highs - 5/10Still testing the battery, will update this review after couple of days.** Forgot to update, battery wasn't special too, returned the item. However I'm a happy user of Sony XB-400 now :)

  This is True review afyer using for a month.. SOUND QUALITY is awesome than i expected, easy to carry, fits in pocket with ease. It gives me full day backup and my usage is moderate,will give 8 hours or more in heavy usage at end of the day more than 30 percent battery is remaining. I didn't felt stressed or pain when i am playing music continuously, i think due to 12mm driver. Each and every beat is crystal clear big shoutout for this. Light weight too.. I am pretty much happy with this purchase on amazon lightening deal. Better than boat 225.No connectivity issues so far and no signal interception or signal loss so far. Battery full charge time is 1 nd half hour. Easy accessible button while riding bike which i found usefull than others. Go for it cheers. True Sound quality

Only one thing i found not good, is when you go for volume more than 80%, then u will not be able to bear the sound, but i think 70-80% is enough to listen song. and one more thing, Infinity 80% = Boat 100%

    Only Bluetooth Connection problems
  
","









  
  
    
  Only been 3 days since I bought it.The only problem i am facing is bluetooth connectivity.Whenever I am connecting it with my laptop,the only thing that is connecting is voice.Let me explain.Whenever a bluetooth audio device gets connected to my laptop having Windows 10,it shows that the device connected has 2 features,voice and music.When the device connected shows that both music and voice has been connected,it means you can both take calls and listen music.But this device is connecting and the only feature it is showing is voice,which means I can only take calls and can't listen to music.I have to disconnect and reconnect again and again to enable both voice and music. Because much of my work revolves around laptops,this is becoming a hindrance and a nuisance.I hope that that this problem doesn't escalate as the days pass.Other than Bluetooth connectivity,everything is working fine.Normal vocals,normal bass and treble notes.A problem I encountered ,which is a bit surprising is that the previous headphone i had was showing a strange problem.When that headphone was connected to my phone,the facebook videos didn't play even after I clicked play.Video statuses on whatsapp also didn't play at all.Mxplayer videos also stopped playing.Just saying about the different problems i had encountered with headphones.Peace out...:-)

  The product is good if you want to use it to listen songs, if you want play games like pubg, etc with this earphones then this is not the product you are looking for as there is sound lag of approx 800ms(i.e. when a player fires bullet at you then the the sound of the bullet fire comes to your ear approximately 800ms later).

  I had to return this product and get a refund for no technical issue but rather callous decisions by JBL over its packaging and its effect on the product ergonomics. I have attached the photos comparing its OEM packaging to another JBL's neckband packaging of exactly the same price available on flipkart.I had discussed this problem with Amazon & JBL over three days and after JBL's non-support over the issue and failing to provide me with an alternative solution. Amazon helped me get a refund on this product. It is a good thing that I had bought this on Amazon else if I had bought it on JBL's website (where it was cheaper) I would never be able to return the product and would have to accept a defective piece.If the problems as mentioned in the photos are not an issue for you. This headphone does provide a solid audio experience.

Good call quality.13 - 15 ft range.Cons -Not for sport activities, as it keeps on slipping from the ear. Basically no locking mechanism.I usually listen to Polk audio.. and have listened to many headphones .Sound quality is easily the best even when compared with wired earphones under 2000.Violins ,guitars and background instruments come to life.Vocals are little recessed , not forward .Bass is smooth. Not thumping one. It's more musical.Good imaging and soundstage. When comparing it with high end headphones ,you will feel it bit muffled.But good part is ,it still goes on and touches little nuances of the song which other earphones clearly miss out on this price bracket.

  Impressed with the JBL N120. The sound was quiet loud. The sound output was very good along with decent bass. Had bought Realme buds air for 4k and had to return it since it was not good for calls. Had done enough research on glide N120, boat 255, Realme buds wireless, Skullcandy inkd, Samsung level u, boult neckband etc.+veBuild is very good even though it‚Äôs plastic except for earbuds which has metal in it.You get a voice over for every operation that you do like switch on/off pairing on/off, bass mode etc which is very helpfulSound output in terms of volume is quiet loudThe Bass is also good and this is very relative as to how much one would like to have.The neckband as such is get flexible unlike others as you can easily wrap them and carry alongCall quality over mic was good as well. If you want your earphones to be out of the world for calls during all noisy scenarios then you have to go for active noise cancellation only which will cost you more than 10k.I am yet to test the battery life but it took not more than 1.5 hours to fully charge.I am using it with iPhone so no issues on connectivity with iOS as wellLong press on the power button automatically calls the last dialled number.

  Hello Guys,These reviews after using few days.Initially heard from friends using bluetooth earphone make headache by its radiationAs this is not in ear buds so that, radiations are not effected as I heard from others. Even after long use as well.Well designed, fit properly inside ear. It will perfect if you are using while running on treadmill or on cycling. It has good connectivity if your device is in one room and while working you might need to go other room it gives same sound clarity without any disturbance on calling as well.Sound is nice and clear for music it has equaliser settings to change sound mode.Battery backup and magnetic connection is nice but recommend to keep in good earphone box or in pouch when not in use.

  I have no idea why there are so many negative reviews for this one. I think these are truly amazing in this price segment and a few segments above as well. They sound unbelievably good for this price! Build quality is too good! Amazing bass! If you find the bass over powering, you can always switch to normal mode.And DO remember to choose the right ear plug size - it makes a world of difference in the sound quality. You need to get a perfect air tight seal.

  Guys I am just giving this reveiw after testing the BH in my iphone ,laptop, android phone.It has two modes normal and dbassWe will never use normal because it's very normal like a local headphones.I bought it at 899Dbass is ok not so greatTried with full volume in iphone it's really annoyingIt will damage your ear if you keepI used all top brands heaphone like apple sony OnePlus bullet etcThis is not a worthy for long hours ..... disappointed actually.I listen üëÇ to all types of songs from English Tamil hindi telugu...punjabi..If you listen to old songs it will be worse like anything.But people who use it for calls and audio video classes this is best at this price.It will connect to multiple devices but it take bit long time like 1 - 2 min to automatically connect.Sometimes I feel the bass isn't working even I listen to latest song with high quality.Battery is good, 7 hours as promised it will stay awake. I like itIf you listen in low volume your ears are safe.

  This is an average product.Sound quality during phone calls are bad. The voice is not that sharp enough , kind of muddy.It doesn't have auto disconnect, if you happen to connect and keep it on at night, by morning you will see 40-50% battery drain.It can connect to two devices at a time, that is nice feature.There was some auto disconnect and reconnect between long usage say 1 hour calls or music, which is a little irritating.

  The Glide 120 consists of 12mm drivers that ensure the sound quality and provides you with ultimate stereo brilliance. I wear my neckband at all times. Definitely comfortable and great sound quality. This product provides better bass, smooth treble, and pure audio with high and low identification. Sometimes, you may also enjoy surround sound in it. Therefore it is the best product for the collar headphone lovers who wish to enjoy soothing music while on the go.

Should straighten out after a few days.Playback button features (skip song/ Siri) different from from normal headphones like holding down the volume button to move between tracks.Design is old compared to what‚Äôs trending in the market.

But it shouldnt matter. If u are worried about the battery draining hold the play button for 5 secs to turn it off.One thing i noticed, when the battery is low the tempo of the song reduces. Its actually Weird.Otherwise its good in every aspect. Nothing to complain about.Yet to check the water resistance and longevity.Bottomline : You Wont get a better one in this price range ...!

  Infinity (JBL) Glide 120 metal in ear.... I purchased it along with Maono AU-D30. Got delivered both on next day. Plastic quality is very cheap. Takes longer than Maono to power on also takes much time to connect. Sound quality is good. But bass lover stay away. If you like to listen bass, then go for Maono. Infinity has 2 settings:- one is Normal and the other one is Deep bass. When you switch over to deep bass you won't feel any huge difference actually. It is just like thump becomes loud at the same volume, that's it. Its is not like Heavy or Explosive as older JBL in-ear earphones used to have or Maono AU-D30 has.

    This took me back to 80s where the background noise was normal
  
","









  
  
    
  I would recommend this product only to someone who has never used a handsfree. If you have used any basic handsfree earlier you would not be able to appreciate this. There's so much background noise like the classic ""khrkhrkhrkhr"" sound that makes you feel like you're in the 80s. Bluetooth hearing while on a video call is of low quality and the sound is very unclear and would want you to go off bluetooth and just talk on speaker. This is only good for music. Otherwise the sound quality during phone calls, other online calls and video calls will make you want to regret connecting the handsfree altogether. Do yourself a favour, and if you want a good Bluetooth handsfree for calling and video calls search for more options.

  The sound quality is good and extra bass effect is an added feature. Battery back up is also reasonable. However, if you are buying it for your jogging/running purposes, please think again. The band is too light and keeps slipping from shoulder and it is quite annoying to adjust it often. Bluetooth range is quite good and the call feature is also up to the mark. Backward compatibility with lower version of bluetooth appliances is decent and there is no disturbance.

Highs are good, mods are ok, lows not so much. Bass is good. Look and packaging is ok. Durability can't aay cause i just got it. Lets see...Updating after about one month use. Neither the microphone nor the earpiece working. This is despite no tugging or harm to the product. Waste of money.

  If you are spending this much bucks, use it to buy other branded headset. This product really sucks. My earlier stint with JBL headphones has been amazing but this infinity product by harman disappointed me a lot though I can understand that this is an average product launched by them to target customer who does not like to spend too much on earpeices. Beleive me, try aome other brand, this is not a quality product. Battery backup also sucks like anything. I am a JBL/HK fan and my expectation from this brand was really compromised after buying this cheap product. Anyways, I went to buy this product after reading a lot of reviews here and found that they were talking about deep bass, I think those people haven't experienced good bass and therefore any bass is a good bass to them. This product sucks in simple language. If you want to buy, you r still open to consider this product.

  I purchased this product considering its a Harman brand. So my expectations for sound quality was some what high but I'm disappointed. Bass is full and pronounced, mid are okay and highs are simply missing and muffled. Moreover I don't feel it's a polished product. Specs on paper are very good like bluetooth 5.0 and IPX rating but using product is a different experience. Bluetooth takes more than 3 seconds to connect everytime. It is impossible to turn on bass mode by holding volume up and volume down button, all it does is disconnect from the device. And if you don't hold power off button for 5 seconds and leave it in 4 or 4.5 seconds it will call the most recent dialled number. Overall I want to say I'm not happy with this porduct but I'm still giving it a 3 rating for the amount of base it provide. If all you care about is base you can buy it.

  Trust me guys I am in the field of music past 30 years and the quality I heard with Infinity Glide 120 is equally the same effect I last heard with the Sony Ericsson walk man series mobile back in 2006. Please learn to adjust the mobile equaliser so you don't get a headache due to the thump deep bass. Secondly, please be very carefull for people who plug this on your ear while you drive or ride in a car or motorbike as you really won't be able to hear if anyone honks or stands near by and speaks to you. You will be absolutely in music world and might get into seriously road incidents if you are not mindful during traffic conditions.I must take the liberty to say don't waste much money with Bose or other brands as the quality you get with Infintiy is truly awersome and you will never regret. Soft volumes during nights is suggested. Please go ahead and buy. Enjoy th music times and be safe when you travel.

  After using for 15days I'm reviewing the product, Do not waste your money on this product. It is pathetic when you talk on call, there is no noise cancellations, also it is not good to use while you r jogging it will just keep jumping on ur neck as the wire is too flexible, battery will last for 3 hrs if used continuously. Sound quality is okay too much of bass which is not necessary at all. Dont fall for branded name of jbl it's not worth. There is no auto bluetooth connect and auto off which indeed drains ur battry of handset aswel of the buds, it hardly keeps u connected to ur fone if u move far from your mobile more than 20meters.Not worth at all

  I have used it for a week now, the deep base mode is good, I have personally felt that one side is less effective as left side sounds a little bit slow, I mean it is noticeable that both the sides are not equal. But yes in this price this is the best quality earphones. My review on the beach band is that, it is comfortable to carry as it is wire only, but the problem is it is unable to hold the side bars steadily because of their weight, every time you put one side one the other side keep going on down side and the mic is below your chest, and the person on the other side can't hear you. Also if the mic is little bit far from where it should be, it doesn't catch your voice, so this is the major problem I am facing.

  It has great sound considering the price. These earphones have got two EQ modes, normal and deep base. And I would say deep base mode justifies its name. I am also impressed with the mic performance, I can take calls easily, no complaints from the caller side as well.The battery backup is about 7 hrs, and it takes 1.5 - 2 hrs to charge completely. Company doesn't provide any charger, one can use any micro USB charger where output is not greater than 5 v and 1.2 A as per user manual.I cant' exactly give the Bluetooth range, but works fine if I stay in the same room.Overall build quality is also nice, this has soft neck band, one can easily fold it and keep it in pocket.

  This earphones almost completely seal your ears, bass is quite high even in normal mode, good for watching movies and music, call quality is good also. But battery life is average, comfort is not upto the mark, careful when changing the ear buds tips as the net on the buds are very near to the surface and super fragile and can break even with a blow of wind. Ear buds are little heavy. Not tested it for gaming. But in the given price range it's quite impressive. Super easy to handle and carry... made for rough use. But be careful its volume can go quite high, and since it completely seals your ears, u can even listen to the thunderstorms, so do not use it outside, roads or public place. Bluetooth range is good and well built and swaet or splash proof. 12mm dynamic driver truly delivers. All over if u r looking for something to rough use indoor or for gym and u want it for music and movies, it's quite good in rs 1299/-. The price of this product often changes in Amazon. I found the lowest to be rs. 1299/-.

Recharge time mentioned on Box: 1.5 Hrs. Time taking: Around 2 Hrs. on a 5Volt 2 Amp Charger.Call Quality:This is the weak point of this product. The mic quality is not that great. It does not pickup the voice that good. It is just very average. Not recommended, if calling is very important or primary.Bottom line:  If listening is the primary need (and very high treble is not required) along with some basic calls feature, definitely go ahead, you will not regret. The sound quality is really great after burnout of 2-3 hrs.

  I have been using boatrockerz 255f amd then i switched to this earphone, the voice is loud from boatrockerz, the build quality is good, it is just light weight, when you are on a two wheeler then you need to keep a watch on this earphone because it tends to fly away,you need to constantly ajust the mic because it flies away due to light weight. Don't expect a thumping bass from this earphone, i bought this earphone for 899rs, but even for 1100rs it is a good deal.On warranty terms jbl replaces your earphone,they don't repair so this thing is good.The fit is also nice.

  I choose this for the first time on the behalf of the name of Harman and jbl, I also have real me buds q and sony earphones, talking about the above purchase I advise you to all that go for this if only if you have only tight budget or gift someone e.g wife or children or elder ones.Peoples who are using sony didn't expect so much from this, this only good for regular work conditions but if you want more then forget.I listen so much songs, I have both music apps you tube music and jio saavn but this one good for jio app.But I have to tell one thing on highest volume the quality of sound gets high, but that sound we can't bear for long time periods as 12mm drivers give big sound.Company have to work on this this is my own experienceGood for everyday use which is optional for another expensive one,  equalizer setting just average only two modes normal and bass, first one ok only

  I am writing this review with the intention to help online buyers. I bought PTron Pride earphones from this website almost 2  ago. These earphones are premium in touch and feel. These earphones are very comfortable to put on and off. The in-ear design reduces external noises and helps in crisp and clear music experience. It also has a mic and control button to answer phone calls and control music.

  These are excellent for under 600. I own e10c, zsn pros etc and bought these since i had a cash back offer and i only had to pay 250.These are rebranded tangmai f3's, a somewhat unpopular chinese earphone and those sell for around 1000 on aliexpress.Coming to the review, the sound quality on these are definitely better than sennheiser cx2 streets, everything is better defined compared to them and i am genuinely surprised at how these sound. The only problem is that the sound is not clean. There is a lot of mid bass and no sub bass rumblings, Mids are muddied and sounds thin overall. But then again i am comparing these to earphones over 1000. These are probably better than anything in their price range.

But this headphone gave a positive thought on pTron. It has very good call clarity and Mic is also giving best output in other side. Also while listing music and movies it gives clear background effects to our ears without any noise. Now I am using this in my laptop too. Thanks pTron for developing such a nice headphone.

And the rich metallic look (since it is of metal, not plastic) really makes it durable, rich-looking, and extremely awesome product! Best wired headphone with mic! I was currently using JBL C500 which also is in this range, but now I would choose this everytime. The bass quality, sound quality and noise cancellation, all of it is better comparing to JBL C500Si which comes under this budget. It also is more durable, much better looking and an Indian product.

  Been using these for 2 days now and have a few observations.Pros:Sound quality - It is pretty damn good. It is correctly named the Bassbuds because the bass is truly something nice here. I was pleasantly surprised with it. The highs are a bit on the muted aise though. The sound isn't as fuller as I had hoped it to be. But at least the bass is nice!Value for money: These truly are value for money.Battery backup: Fhe battery backup is decent. But rather low of you listen at full volume and songs with high amount of bass.Cons:Build quality: The build quality is the worst thing about this. It truly shows that it is budget oriented. The plastic used is pretty bad. Both in headphones and the base unit. Sometimes it feels like you will break it just opening up the base unit. The headsets also feel very flimsy. Feels like the buttons will break pretty soon.My unit in particular feels a bit defective, the headsets are rather loose in the base unit, and just closing the base unit's door sometimes ends up moving the headset in it and it stops charging and the hesdphone turns on thinking it has been removed from the base unitI wanted to rate it higher and I would have, but the build quality leaves a lot to be desired.

  Well...if u wanna try a decent TWS(True Wireless Stereo) go for this one.Due the cost. you get a fully plastic earbuds that fits in really good. Make sure to change earbud tips if u are uncomfortable. It's light weight so for long seasons you want feel them in ur ears.So the noise cancellation is ok not so much good but can't complaint about it in this price point.Main thing about this TWS is bass.. that's more than enough to enjoy music & sound quality is decent enough to enjoy movie and music.

  PTron earbuds are really amazing. I wasn't expecting this good, but it turns out to be the best earbud. Awesome sound quality, super Bass, good connectivity, battery lasts for around 3-4hrs in a single charge and with almost 2hrs of charging in case you get another 3-4hrs.The best thing about this earbud is you can use it as mono or stereo bec both the earbud gets control button in which you can receive and end calls, music - play, pause, previous and next song track can also be changed and long press the button will take you to google assist.Only disappointing thing is there is no button to control volume. Volume has to be adjusted from mobile it self and the quality of the earbud looks cheap plastic but when it comes to the price this things can be ignored.Other than that this is a perfect earbud i have been using this since 5days.  Bass lovers will love this, perfect for running and gym as well doesn't fall from ears.

    Cheapest and Usable TWS earbuds under 1000 rupees
  
","









  
  
    
  Hi everyone,I recently purchased these ptrons cheap TWS earbuds and pretty amazed by the output they produce.These are the best TWS earbuds in 1000 rupees, well difficult to digest that TWS is now available in 1000, there was a time when it was hard to get good wired earphone for 1000 rupees, but now you can get not just Bluetooth but TWS in this price so this is how the technology has evolved a lot in last 3 years.So before diving, deeper let's see what is inside the box.a. Ptrons Tws earbudsb. Extra pair of earbudsc. a micro usb-b cable for chargingd. user manualLet's bifurcate the pros and cons in detail.1. Build quality (5/5)The build quality is great with tws earbuds having solid design and lightweight, although they are not comfortable in ears.2.Sound quality (4/5)Sound quality is good if not the best in the price point with vocals clear but you will find distortion building up once you crank the volume above 70% which is not a big deal as these are cheap earbuds but if you will listen at 50% I think you will have the best experience3.Deep bass. (5/5)You will find deep and punching bass though they are not tuned still you will love deep bass anyhow.4.Noise Isolation (4/5)The noise isolation is good and offer 50-60% isolation and will work only if you have the right ear tips otherwise, noise reduction will be pretty less than what I am mentioning.5. Button response (5/5)The button response is great without any visible delay or lag and you can do play/pause, forward/previous, Vol+/Vol- etc.The button is also bigger in comparison to other earbuds so it is easy to press and does not give pain in ears.6. Call Quality (3.5/5)Call quality is mediocre and can be used for responding emergency calls and will not recommend to buy them for dedicated video or voice calls if you are outdoor for most of the time though they work better if you are inside as they don't have any noise reduction technique or at least I can't find that.7. Connectivity and Comfortability (4/5)The connectivity is good and connection does not break even if you are 10 m away but comfortability is not so good as they don't fit perfectly in ears.(I have small ears but if you have big ears definitely hey will fit)8. Battery life and charging (3.5/5)The battery life is good not the best if we consider the price and can also for around 3 hrs depends on what you are listening to what % volume Also they can roughly charge two times your earphones from empty to full and the charging case takes almost 2 hrs to charge completely.9. Dust and water-resistant rating (3/5)There is no mention of any dust or water-resistant rating on these so if you want to use them in Gym use it on your risk as chances are you may damage them.There is a little bit of chance that they are having some sort of water-resistant but not mentioned but the chances are very slim.10. Value for Money (5/5)Yupp, These are best TWS earbuds available in 1000 rupees in India and I have not sen any other TWS earbuds for the same price point.Thee have scored 42 out of 50 in my test so pretty much usable product and not the garbage item.So looking for something in 1000 rupees go for it.

  sound and bass quality wise these are excellent but there is issue with connectivity that is not at all reliable even sometimes during call it get dropped resulting disruption in conversation. Its connection keeps dropping no matter whether you are listening music or having a call. So Ptron need to work on connectivity part else its good budget TWS earphone. I am returning it due to uselessness of it because connectivity is everything for its usage else its just a micro speaker without any interface or usefulness.

  Coming straight to the point.1. Sound quality is not that great on high pitch.2. Bass is good.3. It hardly covers 10 m. Can't go to the next room while talking, it get disconnects.4. The size of the buds little large to look but fitting in ears is superb, pairing, charging etc are excellent.5. You can watch movies with sound effects but bass need to be adjusted on high sounds.  On high sound the clarity is missing.Rest all looks good.I have got these for ‚Çπ999/- so can't expect better than this. Value for money.

  Should not have purchased the product even with such a low price. The Bluetooth connection keeps disconnecting and connecting. Don't believe this is worth the price paid.The plastic and the product in itself seem to be of low quality and doesn't feel very good.The only plus is the way it sits in the ear comfortably. Rather go for the more expensive and reliable products.

    1 year review: Pick this up if you want a decent TWS.
  
","









  
  
    
  1 year update:I got this last year September, so its been over a year now. These are still chugging on. I see a minor loss in battery life. But even after dropping it and even splitting it 3 times, this is still working fine. The unit is made of really hard plastic and the mechanism, is pop-on. So even if it comes apart it does not crack and still have be put together. Sound quality and connectivity is still the same(mediocre). You can read the full review for that.Calls are outstanding. Still use it to take daily office calls. Its damn convenient.Original review:The wireless earbud has been all the rage. Ever since apple released the airpods and started the race for this new market segment, we have had 100s of it. But the main problem was the price. The prices were nowhere near affordable. And for bluetooth or other wireless tech, which is still not nearly as good as wired audio, that was a huge ask.I wanted to try one, but I wasn't planning on spending any more than my Sennheiser Cx275, which have served me well. Ptron 's bassbuds hit that sweet spot with good price and okayish track record. I got it and don't regret it one bit.Pros -PriceSuperb call qualityExcellent battery(4-5 hours)Comfortable for long periods of timeCharges fairly quickCons -Audio quality is muffled and lack depthThe product isnt fine tuned,the instructions and beeps before Calls are extremely loud for my likingPairing Throws some issues now and then(not a deal breaker)Build is not great, but can't complain since it's feather light

  Considering all the reviews and comments for this product, I decided to purchase this product. I received this product yesterday. Within an hour of using the product for approximately couple of hours, it started creating problems.Firstly, when in an moving vechicle it automatically disconnects and reconnects again sometimes even on only one side. Hence, there is no continuity in music.Secondly, it is only connected uninterruptedly when your phone is held close by to the both units and the moment it is kept away for eg in the pocket of pants, it again creates same issue as earlier mentioned.Overall, please don't buy this product. Waste of even 1000

  In the box, we have a micro USB to USB cable for charging. 2 pairs of small and large ear tips. A quick start guide, the charging case, and the earphone.When you take out the earbuds from charging cum storage case. They'll start. If not you can press the button on both the Earbuds for 2 seconds and they'll start. Blue and red light start blinking on both and they both paired each other automatically. Then one Earbuds light will be off and they're ready to be paired. You can see Ptron Earbuds on mobile. They're connected and blue light will be blinking slowly.When you want to play the music just press the button once on any earbud and music will start. The same will go for pause the music. If you want to go to the next track Press the button twice and for the previous track press it three times. If you press down and hold the button your voice assistant either its Google assistant or Siri, it'll start.Ear tips fit in your ears perfectly and it won't fall off even if you're running or in the gym. These are Bluetooth 5.0 Earbuds with a 10mm driver. So they produce very good sound with a good amount of bass. Bass is very good. It's not too much and won't overshadow vocals. Vocals are clear and you can hear the dialogues or lyrics very clearly even with high bass. There are not many cons but it would be better if the sound is a little bit louder.Battery backup of the Earbuds also good as it gives you 4 hrs of backup with 1.5 hrs of charging timeSo if you want to buy cheap true wireless Earbuds and want to have full wireless experience on a budget you can go for this one. In this budget, these are very good true wireless Earbuds.

  Bought this as a stop gap item while my regular bluetooth device gets repaired oncevthe service cneters reopen in this lockdown.While this was an economical choice I made after carefully going through reviews but even at 1100/- this turned out to be a poor choice and thankfully I trust Amazon to refund as promised and got my money back after using this only for 4 days.Don't mean to be too harsh and rarely post negative reviews but this pair keeps falling off, sound is robotic if at all audible in the first place to the other caller and music quality is similar to a roadside wired headset. The case was very fragile and all plastic, as were the buds, but that is understandable at this price point and should be fine if handled with appropriate care even for a much longer period...Would have still kept it as an acceptable standby pair if only people didn't keep complaining in 7/10 calls made using this piece. The connectivity range was adequate  though and I think there is potential for p-tron to capture the market at this price point if they can fix the audio issues.In Amazon market searching for a economical but working buds again :-(

    True Wireless Bassbuds
  
","









  
  
    
  I was looking for a true wireless earbuds under the 1000 rupees price segment and I decided to go for this pTron earbuds. Let me go through my experience with these earbuds.Build quality and design:The design of these earbuds is very elegant and most importantly these earbuds are super comfortable to wear. You can easily use these for 2-3 hours continuously and it won't hurt your ears.As the most of earbuds, these are also made of plastic. However, this earbuds looks very premium. It comes with a case and more specifically I would say a charging case and this also looks very premium.Loudness and clarity:I use these earbuds mostly with my phone and occassionally with my PC. But no matter with which device I use these earbuds are very loud. You would not use it at 100 per cent volume. However, unlike other earbuds audio clarity of these is very good even at the full volume. You won't notice any noise or distortion in the audio.Audio signature:As per my observation and experience with these earbuds, it has a extra bass sound signature. Therefore, bass lovers like me would love to have these earbuds. It has a very crisp audio with extra thump and punchy lows.Mic:Firstly, I was very sceptical about its mic performance because it's positioned around your ears. But its odd positioning doesn't affect the mic's performance. I have taken calls with these in noisy environment and trust me these has performed exceptionally well.Battery life and charging time:In a full charge these earbuds lasts more than 6 hours if you are watching movie or listening to music. It has 50 mAh battery which takes around an hour to charge fully. The charging case has 400 mAh battery capacity and it can fully charge these earbuds for 4 times. Which is quite good at this price range.Miscellaneous things:These earbuds have a button on top of it which changes a track if pressed twice and pushes the track if pressed one time. Long pressing of the button starts the Google assistant. Which is a very useful feature.Lastly, I would say at this price range these are one of the best earbuds.

  Overall I am giving 4 star to this product. Let me explain why1) sound quality is pretty descent and you will not find any problem with that2) Battery backup is also , you can use it for 35 hours with 1.5 hour charging time after every 5 hours of continuous music so battery section this device is perfect.3) Range is quite good when fully charged you can easily go to 1 floor ahead and listen the music clearly.4) To be honest, device does not look cheap from any angle , case is quite sturdy and have a premium look.Cons1) If you cover the buds with just  your hand it will not be able to connect with your device which i have never seen in neck band designs (mi, real me, one plus).2) In terms of fir to ear , its not that bad but not too good also as it keeps falling out while exercising .3) Connectivity to multiple device is also not good as it can only receive audio from one device at a time . it means if you connect 2 phones and you get call on any 1 you will be not able to pickup as only one device can be connected.At this budget , I will say buy call to get initial experience of TWB.

    Average products and battery performance is not what they claim

  Music play time and talk time are only good for marketing.Brand new earbuds only last for 50 - 60 minutes of talk time and far away from claimed 5 hours.Charging case only able to charge around 1.75 times ( I have charged both ear bud ones and than in next charge only one bud got fully charged) so again it is fast from claim of 3 times charge.This performance is next day of purchase so you can think about after a month or so....Voice quality is extremely poor on call and particularly difficult to understand when you use single buds only.Overall not happy with battery and voice performance.One more suggestions - both buds has push button to accept call or any action and buttons are too hard...after puch buds penetrate in ear and you may feel pain. So better go for touch gesture buds by paying few more buks.

  Only pro is bassy sound. May be good for those who are going to use for listening to music only. Not fit for use as headsetNegatives:Microphone volume is very low. Having to shout to be audible to other persons in callVoice clarity is low.Range of bluetooth is around 15 feet of there is no obstruction. Single wall and it's down to 10 feet max (their claim of 3 feet is pure lie).Becuse of emphasise on bass, voice clarity is compromised.Does not work with Laptop bluetooth the main reason to buy. When connected the sound keeps on fluctuating and shifting between the earbuds. Microphone stopes working within 5-10 minutes of usageBetter pay a little more and buy a reputed one rather than this cheap Chinese product

  I really loved it. Sound clearity is really good, charging capacity  last really long. Bluetooth connect transfer speed are good for listening music and video. But for online gaming sometime 1 or 2 second delay so I did not recommend it for especially PUBG player. and last thing the Bass are not as expected, bass are really low it's an average bass but like I said before sound clarity is perfect. Almost forget it's lil big so better not  wear it while running by for or by bike it fall off easily. we have to push in really hard to get it stick tighter.. Over all it a good product .. Important thing is if we listend long time with a good bass earbud we can easily damage our ear. so, it's an averagely balanced  bass I guess. But for me I hope on future they add more bass because it doesn't came out as a name BASSBUD..

  Here is my review after using pTron, Boat 121 & Boat 141. Since Price range of pTron is near to Boat 121, I will be comparing them.Likes ::1) Pretty design2) Good packing3) Portable box4) Low priceDislikes::1) Too Big on ears. Looks odd.2) Case is made of cheap plastic. The lid issemi transparent. Gives a cheap look.3) Bass is so much that it sounds artificial and drowns all other music.4) You cant bare above 50% volume, can't hear below 10%.5) Battery in case lasts for atleast 3 charges however buds itself looses battery faster.Comparison With Boat Airdopes 121pTron looks and feels cheaper than 121 and is obviously cheaper in price too.Boat 121 looks premium and its digital battery display adds to style as well. Its battery lasts longer and audio is very good with balanced bass and treble. Not excellent but decent.Both have touch buttons but pTron buttons felt harder. Boats 121 is sweat resistant.U can clearly see in the pic that Boat is sleek and small while pTron looks bulky ans protrudes out of the ear.Both are okay for the price you pay. I wouldn't say pTron is bad but you wont be satisfied with its audio quality.If you are not particular about music then you may buy ptron. However calling option on both sounds low for other person.Comparatively I would opt for Boat 121 anytime. Its sale was sky high, so much that others were not getting sold so they pulled it out of list. U may imagine how good it is.I hope this detailed feedback helps you to decide better.

The battery-powered charger cum storage allows to charge it for more than 2-3 times a day that is pretty good6. Battery backup is pretty good and gives 5 - 6hrs of usage7. Single bud can also be used which is pretty good8. The only drawback is the volume control is not provided in the buds, only with the smartphone we should control the volume

    Bang for the bucks, an overall nice package at a low cost!
  
","









  
  
    
  First Impressions:Picked them up at a lightning deal for 999 bucks!Given it's worth a 1000 bucks, you can't complain much as for what you are getting.  The bass is good, but that comes at the cost of sound quality - you can feel it. Everything (bass, treble,...) is kinda well balanced for what you would expect at this price. Sound quality is good overall. Bass quality is fine, but that again comes at the cost of other factors like sound clarity (sort of).Pairing:Unlike other cheaper buds, it doesn't have issues with pairing. It's a smooth process.Value for money: definitely!Buttons: works pretty well. No volume control, not much of an issue again.Build Quality:It's decent at this price, just like you won't ask for all metallic stainless steel finishing in a 10k worth device, you wouldn't mind a whole plastic body for these earbuds at this price tag.However everything comes at a price, and so we get a case made of hard plastic, with a transparent plastic lid. It feels flimsy indeed and I would appreciate if they improve the material a bit.**Also, this maybe a general problem or, something that only mine has - I feel something (some nut/part inside the case is kinda loose and already broken), and it gives a shaking noise as if something has already broken. Now, this maybe a build defect - idk, would appreciate if someone clarifies. Something appears to be damaged/broken inside. Build quality is indeed pathetic, but one can't expect more for 999 bucks, again.Noise Cancellation:There's no noise cancellation as such. If any reviewer says it does - they probably have no idea of how noise cancellation really is. But there's no special noise cancellation feature and you can even hear the slightest of noises/disturbances around.Comfort:I m wearing it at a stretch for over 10 hrs now! It feels comfy indeed but comfort is subjective to a person - but it fits me comfortably. However, sometimes I do feel irritation n pain but I can live with that.Trust me, for this price the level of comfort and ergonomics it's got is amazing, while there's room for improvement.Mic: Decent.Issues:Signal drop, and lags. The Bluetooth chipset is apparently a cheap one and my buds are getting disconnected frequently. This is annoying. It's lagging quite a lot. Maybe the buds are defective. I m planning to replace the thing.Claimed range: 10mWhat u would get: 2-3m, would be lag free, slight lags would be there even then. 5-6 metres if there's absolutely no obstacles, but still not much of an issue in my case.All I can say finally is there's room for improvement!Throw in better, faster charging batteries, Improve build quality, and it would be even better!

You cant play games  like Pubg(sync is very bad) after shooting, enemy will die then you'll hear the gunshot voice.Build quality/Playback time/ Charging time and fit in ear are according to the price. Use good quality buds to fit it perfectly, the one in box is not that greatoverall it is same as high end TWS because no one is perfect, Just want it to last longer.i'll give 7 out of 10In Simple words, Go for it because its a new technology, no TWS is perfect, atleast spending 1K is better than spending 4-5KThanks

  Hey everyone so I have been using these wireless earphones for more than 4 days now and here is my review.1- It's an instant auto-connect Bluetooth device, whereas I need to wait for a minute to connect any other earphones I had before.Build Quality:- The quality of this is nice and the finishing is also perfect as it is made up of a Plastic body and it looks premium. Now coming to the earphones it is also made up of plastic with touch-sensitive buttons for Play/Pause and other functions that are very responsive.Audio Quality:- The audio output is great and the bass is also perfect, the volume is so loud and clear. Working perfectly and supporting even my OnePlus phone.Battery Backup:- It was mentioned that it gives 6 Hours of non-stop Music backup but after a complete charge, It lasted 8 hours without any interruption. After then, you can use 1 side earbud and charge the other, this way these pTron bass buds will last long more than 12 hours since we have a portable charger with it.You can connect 2 buds at a time or you can connect 1 bud at a time. Both options are there.A great headphone at this price range.

Once it charged it can last for almost 5-6 hours.INDOORS - GoodOUTDOORS - Worst/Bad

  When I connected this device to my phone and played a music, the first thing I noticed was the difference in volume on both the earbuds. The right one had more bass and sound while the left earbuds were sounding poor. Secondly when I put a finger or palm over my left ears that moment the right earbuds would cut off. Lastly when I tilt my head around that also results in both the earphones cutting off music. I tried walking with it but frequent sound cut offs made it unbearable. I returned it. I was really looking forward to this tws headset but I was disappointed to the point where now I'm having second thoughts about should I be buying another one.... Bad experience.

    NOT GOOD PRODUCT. FALSE WARRANTY CLAIMS
  
","









  
  
    
  I couldn't hear any sound from the left side and raised a complaint with Support Center (#PR782978) on August 1, 2020.After a chain of correspondence, they advised me to courier the product with the invoice to their seller address. I did that on August 31, 2020.After they acknowledge the receipt of the product under warranty, the gave me an option of either opting for a new same product or alternatively, buying a new pTron product from Amazon.in.Based on their assurance, I purchased the pTron Studio Pro Soundster Over the Ear Wireless from Amazon on September 11, 2020 for ‚Çπ1,199/- and sent them the proof.  Since then, I‚Äôve written numerous mails for the earlier product refund and also tried calling their customer care number (which is always engaged) but to no avail.Its surprising that the Ptron customer care (which promptly responded before receiving the product under warranty) refused to respond to any of my remaining mails.A WORST KIND OF SERVICE. FELT CHEATED AS I HAD TO PUCHASE ANOTHER PRODUCT AND DID NOT GET ANY REFUND FOR THE 1ST PRODUCT AS PROMISED. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING PTRON PRODUCTS.

    Good sound quality but connectivity issues

  Voice quality is very good. Active Noise cancellation is not there but it is not available with  any of the competitors specially in bluetooth earbuds. However connectivity issues crop up every now and then. At times sound dissapears in either of the earbud and sometimes voice lags in 1 earbud due to which it feels like an echo but it is for few seconds only. The earbuds also have a tendency of slipping from the ear. Build quality is decent.  No charger provided only a usb cable. Overall good value for Rs. 1000 and i recommend it. Anything over and above this amount is consumers choice. However its not available anymore on amazon

I chose Ptron earbuds because they were very easy on the pocket but after using them from so many days I gathered enough courage to write this review.Battery backup sound quality and connectivity everything is amazing. Very very comfortable in ears. You can use only one you but if you wish to. And with this option, we connected earbuds with the firestick and now we share the earbuds while watching TV at night. And this helps our baby have a good sleep because she doesn't get disturbed with the noise.

  At this price it's the best. Sound quality and bass are superb as compared to my wired earphones. The only issue is that when you try these on lying on a bed or couch and if you turn to one side, which I do mostly watching a video or movie from my cellphone, one of the earbuds that faces downward falls frequently. It just don't fit tight even after changing the cushions provided for. So I am putting a ear muff to prevent it falling or slipping.. Otherwise value for money..Cheers!

  1. Quality of tune is 60% clear & 40% loud according to your actual input sound quality.2. Though I purchased the product two months back but I had used very rarely & considering the ageing battery life is good. Almost 80% satisfied with battery life.3. Online base test result almost 30 Hz after that no sound received.4. Quality of base according to the price is quite satisfied.5. Main drawback is connectivity, if you move slightly after wearing the device Bluetooth signal cut off automatically.6. Facing difficulty during phone calls, if you move slightly the phone call will disconnect automatically. It seems that, it has a poor Bluetooth connectivity.

    Issue with build quality
  
","









  
  
    
  I have been using this product for a couple of months. I would say this product has a decent sound quality and noise cancellation is fairly good. However, the build quality and fit isn't that great. There's always a chance of it falling down. As a matter of fact, inspire of me being conscious about wearing it most of the time, it dropped from my ear a couple of times and very recently after falling down from my ear it kind of tore apart. Although I managed to reassemble it into workable condition, the blue ring came apart and got lost. I'm not sure if we can get a spare. I think the build quality should have been better.P.S. please note this product lasted atmost 6 months with light usage, post which it switches on after full charge and power goes off within 5-10 mins.

    Really Amazed with performance after 10days , honest review for you all guys

  Hello guys i hope you all may be stuck for buying this product. But Honestly i would like to give you a quick review about those pair they are really very good for many reasons they are compact,high mobility,great bass, and the main thing is the lowest price tws available in the market.I was Stucked Too while ordering them but i found them Helpful and they fulfiled my expectations.we will be talking about its some few featuresbuild quality is overall good but i think it can be better intead of slippery surface.sound is loud but it will be annoying for you because you'll not be able to hear the notes correctly so to fix this you can install an application such as equilizer of 5mb to adjust this after doing this it is delivering a powerful and clearest sound they are really good guys i accept it and the ptron has worked great for it.next is the battery backup it takes about 2 hr tws+charging case to full charge allthough earbuds go to sleep when they are full of charge.I attentioned a thing that it was charging soo fast i left it in charging case for about 40 min after shut down with 0% battery they were full in 40min. And i have not charged them from yesterday and I'm using it regularly it is been 10 days after they delivered it and the performence is really good.it has good range but not much i walked about 20m it was smooth and then it started laging and they are still too big if your ear size is below normal then this is not for you üíîallthough you'll get all those features of a premium pair in ithope you like üôå

    In 999 it is a decent buy
  
","









  
  
    
  1st of all I would like to tell I have used this earphones for a month and giving an honest review.Build quality is decent for the price, after 1 hr you will feel pain in your ears because of the bulky design. In connectivity it does have BT5.0, range is decent, but I have found there is some sound lag in videos when the battery drops to 70%, but it doesn't have this issue always, coming to the sound quality, lows are quite high but it is not punchy, it's hollow I would say, mids are average not great, highs are ok, if you are more into EDM, then you will like this, but not for acoustic lovers, now about calling, indoors mic works decent but in outdoors you have to shout so that the receiver can hear. Even sometimes one buds get connected other don't while paring, the good thing is that if u put the buds in the charging case it gets disconnected and turns off and gets connected when u take out of the case.Verdict : In 1000rs it is a decent but if u want TWS, but don't expect extraordinary performance, ab 1000rs main bacche ki jaan logey kya?If u want a good TWS below 1500 then go for it or else get a mi neckband.And yeah just forgot, there is an annoying notification which keeps telling you every 10s to charge your earphones at 20% volume and below, which is a downside.

  Gor under ‚Çπ1000, its an good purchase, but lavks basic qualities to be called TWS.I purchased the product and within a span of 3 days I had to replace it and then finally return.1. Its not for audiphiles. (Think of it as a ‚Çπ50 earphones you get on Rly stations. So I wont even bother to talk about highs, mids and base)2. The product claims to have microphones on either earbuds, but only the left earbud mic seems to be functional. Other side mic, though not visible is ornamental, I believe.3. Bluetooth latency is good enough.4. I used it while riding (short distance ~ 3-4 kms) to listen to music, but several times the earbuds were struggling to stay connected to my phone, even though the distance was agreeable (I had my phone in my pocket). This was a major No-No for me, else I would have kept it as feature wise I dont expect much from a product worth 1k.Hope this helps.

  The pTron Bassbuds is purely a bundle of joy! These mini-sized fully wireless earpods have everything working in their favour, starting from it's pocket-friendly price and size, to the edgy design and chic hue. pTron delivers amazing sound quality and the noise cancellation is as good as it gets at this price range. The earpods stay in their place and can withstand slight jerks as well. The pods are operated using a touch-button instead of fingerprint-sensors but it's hardly something that I can complain of. Overall, this product is a definite buy!

  I just wanted to see if its worth the hype and it wasnt. If you have used any superior ear buds like that of Apple's or Sony's, then you will really know the difference. It doesn't come to that level and you will always have that incomplete feeling. But if you never going to ever buy such expensive ones, this will do. Even the response is too slow for touches. So buy it only if you don't have any other option.

Earbuds fits quite perfect in the ear and i did tried to use while sleeping and they did not come off in the morning so hats off to this.3. For me it worked for slightly more than 3 hrs of continuous uses and which is quite great.4. Noise cancellation is there so this is a good feature at this price bucket.5. Biggest thing i liked about this earbud is Bass, Bass is very perfect for this range.6. I liked the ability to turn off charging and for this button inside case is provided.Cons:The charging case flip seemed a bit fragile but i feel at this price bucket a little care is surely needed.

  I was already using the Leaf Bass 2 Wireless Headphones & I was pretty much satisfied with them so I decided to buy this Leaf Earpods. I received it before expected delivery date. I opened the box & starting using this earbuds. Now I am using it from last few days. Here are some points which can help you decide to buy...Build Quality--- The Earbuds made by good quality plastic material & light weight. Earbuds are in matt black color & looks premium. The charging case looks very good & it is very useful.Connectivity--- Earbuds comes with Bluetooth 5.0 so it connects with any Android & iOS device. The connection works good upto 10 meters. You can also use it during gameplay. You will not face any audio lag.Sound Output--- It comes with 13mm driver unit im each earbud which produce pretty decent quality sound output. Bass is deep & vocals are clear upto 100% volume. Acoustic & different types instruments sounds can be listen easily. Earpods work good in gaming too but you can fail to differentiate the sounds sometimes. The calling is also good mic works great during calls. Overall I am satisfied with the sound quality.Battery--- I am using earpods from last few days. I use darood throughout the day after a full charge in mixed usage. I also checked the continues playtime so I watch two movies & listen some music then I got 6-7 hrs continues playtime & earpods take 1.5 hr to full charge. The charging case can charge earpods upto 3 times. You can use a single earpod(Left) for calling. And it comes with a special charging adaptor so if you forgot to carry case then you can charge with OTG/Power Bank/Car charger or any other usb 2.0 port.Box Contains- Earpods, Micro USB Cable, Charging Case, Extra Pair of Eartips, USB Adaptor, User Guide & Other Information Cards.Overall I can say the Leaf Earpods are a pretty decent True Wireless Warbirds with Great Build Quality & Decent Quality Sound Output with a good price tag.

  Hi Everyone,So I have been using these earpods or leaf pods (as called by Leaf) and pretty much amazed by the battery life as they are delivering around 7 hrs of juice in a single charge. So after testing each bit here are my findings for this earpods.Let head to the pros and cons directly.pros.1.Sound Quality Starting with sound quality they have a decent sound quality and pretty much acceptable for the price point, let's talk about sound quality in detail.The mid and highs are clear but I personally found the bass is underwhelmed a little bit and I think that is the main reason that they are claiming it can deliver 8hrs of juice. I am not saying that they don't have bass, they have decent bass but not deep bass.2. Deep BassThey are having a balanced sound profile so if you want bass boost or deep bass sound profile you will be little bit disappointed but if you are a balanced sound lover you will really enjoy it.3. Noise IsolationMoving on to the noise isolation I am quite amazed by the degree of noise cancellation they offer. So I am writing this review while commuting and at around 50% volume they are giving around 70% noise cancellation which is great for me. So if you want more noise isolation you can crank up the volume but listening at high volume will damage your ear so I  would prefer it to be around 50% for the best experience.4. Independent Volume ControlBy the way, I forget to mention they have independent volume control so you can control volume from earbuds without disturbing your media volume on phone and in my opinion, this is the best method and gives better controllability.5. Buttons responseButtons are tactile and responsive and can be used for receiving or declining calls. Long pressing the left earbuds will call voice assistant.6. Call QualityNow the question comes whether they can be used for video or voice call. yes, they work great in voice or video call and even if you are in crowded place the listener can hear you clearly and you need not shout for this.7. ConnectivityNow talking about the connectivity it's great as they are having Bluetooth 5.0 which reduces latency and increases battery life.8. ComfortabilityThey are really comfortable in your ears and sweat proof makes them usable in Gym or in running and believe me they will not fall from your ear even if you try hard.9. Battery LifeThey weigh just 12gm and the battery last for around 7-8 hrs depending on music type and volume and also charger give you more than a day battery juice, precisely 25-26 hrs which is really impressive.10. Extra Monopod ChargerOne more thing which I found interesting is that they have monopod charger (check images) and I think every TWS company should start including them in earpods so that even if you lose your charger then also you can charge earbuds using a monopod and use them and they will not be a complete wastage.Now moving to the cons.1. Apart from not having deep bass, I did not found any issue with these earbuds and I think this company is providing everything that consumer wants from truly wireless earbuds.

  Well first thing first do not buy the product, it has one basic problem which undermines its value, utility and anything good with it,being a bluetooth device it fails to connect to the device. Howsoever good the quality of sound may be,  but if the earbud fails to connect to the device or even if it connects it fails to stay connected the quality of the sound,  the comfort of wearing them etc etc is of no good. The calling quality of the pods is pathetic.  Service offered by the company is even worse, they will ask you for the complete photograph of the product and will raise technical hurdles to buy time so that the 10 day replacement window elapses. One other point they offer only replacement of a defective product with another one which probably will also be defective.

  I bought these after searching a lot. I considered almost all the options available because budget wasn't an issue. On reading various reviews, I found out that even the Jabras and Airpods aren't perfect. Hence, making a choice was tough.I went with these because it is moderately priced and reviews were a little more on the positive side than others.Coming to product,Pros:-> Fits amazingly and comfortably. No trouble at all even after wearing them for more than two hours. They don't fall off the ears while running (Didn't try any other workout method).-> Build quality gives premium look.-> Sound quality is what makes it one of the best product out there right now. Clear vocals, and bass is way above the standards of wireless earphones. Volume is also loud enough.-> It claims to give a massive battery backup and I've started believing thatit's true. Been using continuously since I got the product.-> Call quality was tested in silent environment and it went smooth.-> Noise cancellation is exceptionally good.Cons:->Case could have been of better quality.-> Noise leakage might be a problem in silent environment. People around me could here sounds even on 40% volume.Overall, an amazing product no matter the price range. True wireless earphones are in a nascent stage right now, but this product really stand out of the crowd.

    Update: RETURNED! Average Sound Quality, Great Appearances
  
","









  
  
    
  So this is an update after using for 10days:The sound quality while listening to songs is average, the bass is not good and you definitely miss the rock experience while listening to beat thumping tracks.The mic is not tuned appropriately to receive only speakers voice while in a phone call. Rather, the mic picks up and boosts background noises so much that the receiver at the other end of the call hears only background noise and not your voice at all.I have returned the product because as much as I was excited, I was disappointed more with the product experience.Just purchased the Leaf Pods and used it only for one day, hope to review later again.The sound quality is average, I am directly comparing with Seinnheiser & Skull Candy earphones. As the claim True Bass, the low notes and bass are not well defined and do not have the ""thump"" impact.For call quality, the noise cancellation is good. The sound receiving quality while on call is good.

    Best true wireless earbuds for this price range
  
","









  
  
    
  First of all the build quality is awesome these earphones are very premium looking and gives a very good hands on experience. The sound quality is good vocals are clear and bass is sufficient. The best feature is the battery life. Compared to other true wireless earbuds these are battery beasts. It can easily last upto 5-6 hrs on an single charge. The only minor problem i could see is that the lid of the case attracts lots of scratches. Overall these are the best true wireless earbuds out there at this price range.

Mids are very recessed treble appears to be grainy and bass is just decent. Personally i did not like the sound quality.The fit is fine and would not easily drop out of your ears but not so good as well.Noise Isolation is just average and call quality the same.If you are someone who‚Äôs looking to try an earphone keep in mind that they cannot be returned they can only be replaced.

  Product is decent and value for money.

  These are amazing. Probably the best in the price segment. Sound quality is awesome..  Bass is good. Thanks to the light weight.. One can wear these for a longer period of time without any irritation. Fit is snug..  Making them very handy for jogging. Pairing is a very simple process. Long press the function button on the right pod, pair it with the other pod, once both the pods are paired, we can pair them with our device.  Both the pods have multifinctional keys with different functions. Single press on either of the pods to play/pause the music. Double press on the right pod to increase the volume, double press on the left pod to decrease the volume. Long press the right pod to activate Siri/Google assistant. Long press on the left pod to call the recently dailled contact. The battery backup is good.. They work fine for about 6 hours with a full charge. The charging case is stylish and handy. With the case,  one can charge the pods fully 3 times. So, it is approximately 24 hours of music on the go if the case is fully charged. The box contains the case, pods themselves, a USB power cable,  USB charging device which can seat one pod at a time. And few spare ear buds of different sizes. All in all, it is made in India with a warranty of 1 year from the date of purchase. I am convinced that these are the best pods for this price range. Go for them.

    Leaf Pods: The Most Comfortable TWS Earbuds Out there.
  
","









  
  
    
  I've been wanting to try my hands on TWS ear buds for quite a long time and recently I was able to do so. However, my experience with it wasn't as good as I thought it would be the Earbuds I used before were not comfy, the bass wasn't set properly and overall it wasn't a good deal. Some months later, I found the Leaf Pods and thought of getting hands on it. These were the best pair of TWS I had ever seen.The case was also pretty decent, however, I fear the case top to break away because of the plastic used. But nevertheless, everything is amazing. It is so compact you can fit it into your pockets and totally forget about it and same is the scenario with the Earpods. Its very comfortable and very handy when it comes to play/pause the music or even to trigger your Google/Siri Assistant.The sound quality is basic Leaf tradition, with deep bass and amazingly balanced treble which gives out the perfect audio that one would like. And as for the battery life, its been almost a week since I received the Leaf Pods and its still working without a single charge so I guess you can say its a plus.Although, the one downside that I think the product has is its pricing. Its priced at Rs. 4,000 which in my opinion is a bit to heavy. Overall its a good pair of earphones and if you can afford it, then you should go ahead.

    Wanted to love it but sadly couldn't
  
","









  
  
    
  I was REALLY looking forward to loving these, and supporting an Indian brand. I bought three. For me and my family members. And sadly, there's been nothing but dissapointment.The pods, even when synced, turn off sound on the right ear. Sporadically. With no warning. Really sucks when you're in the middle of listening to a meditation.Customer service takes forever to accept that you have a genuine problem. And after a month of back and forth they did send me a replacement which ended up having the same issues.While on calls, people can't hear you well enough. Audio is muffled on both ends. You sound muffled and both people are frustrated until the call ends or you decide to remove the pods and just talk directly through the phone.It does envelop you in a sound bubble so you can't really hear noises around you when you wear them. If that's something you like then that's good, but really not the best when you're out in the streets,and need to be aware of traffic and other things.Bass quality is decent. Not extraordinary, and when compared to the other issues, it really doesn't seem like the best pay off.I really wanted to love this and support the brand. But sadly, I don't. I regret my multiple purchases.Yes is less pricey compared to some well known brands, but honestly it's more frustrating in use and for me, the tradeoff has just not been worth it.

  I had bought these peace of headphones after doing a lot of research. After using it for almost a week below are my findings:-Looks premium from the moment you open it.-Fits into your ears perfectly and does the job while running, working out or even playing football-Battery back up is great. You are good for more than 24hrs (you can have 3 full charges from the box plus one full charge for the earphones).-The best part is the usb drive given along with the earphones which will come really handy during emergency situations and you can charge one single earpiece if your box is out of juice.-It connects really fast with my iPhone and no issues of connectivity till now.-The sound is very clear and the bass is just right(I am not a bass freak, does a very good job with half volume)-Calls are flawless and you really dont have to shout. Good for calls in crowded places also. The other person will be able to hear your voice rather than surrounding noise.-Noise cancellation is not that great but pretty good.-Overall a great product at the price at which I got it during Amazon sale @3499.Totally worth it!! Great job Team Leaf!!

  A really amazing piece of tech and above my expectation at this price point! Seriously these pair of earphones can surely compare to the standards of much expensive earpods like the Samsung earpods and the airpods by apple considering the design, sound quality, portability and ease of usage. Really premium looking and out of the box itself it gives you the feeling of satisfaction that you've invested money in something that's useful and totally worth every penny! Got these for my dad and the next thing I knew was my dad over joyed with these latest pods and enjoying every moment of the earpods.If you're even reading this comment, you might have surely come a long way searching for something that's not expensive yet with great quality. Well, here you are! From experience I must say that the earpods by the other companies are only overpriced and nothing else only because of the reputation of the brand. I have full confidence that leaf as an upcoming company would surely do well over the years.

  I have used these earphones extensively for the past 15 days or so. Here is my full review:Build- 4/5: The build quality is solid and sturdy. The material used is plastic but feels premium. The buttons on the sides are tough and over all I'm happySound- 4/5: The sound is very high on bass and good for gym and workout. Noise isolation is good and the earphones are comfortable for the ears. For this price the sound quality doe not disappoint.Battery: I get 3.5-4 hours of use and then additional 8-10 hours from the case. Which is not bad. the earphones charge relatively quickly though USB-C over micro USB would've been betterOverall- 5/5: The earphones are of very good quality for this price. definitely worth the buy. I did experience BT connectivity drops once in a while with the right earphone but it reconnected immediately. The control and the combinations for different functions can get slightly tricky to memorise.

I got headache and feel stress and pressure around the head not sure if it is coz of Bluetooth rays. It has many features but as mentioned in the box the sound quality is not good.

My warranty will soon expire and they are still wasting my time. I simply regret purchasing it. My 3500 wasted in no time.

  I have replaced these earbud at least 6 times and every time the new one has some problem or other. Currently it will have charging issue with charging case on full complete charging it is hardly able to charge my ear bud only 1-2 times. Moreover some times one of the buds automatically get disconnected and then you have to reset it every time.Earlier I have used many other brand bluetooth earphones but this is the first I am having so much problem.

    Awesome Clearity with Deep Bass
  
","









  
  
    
  After hunting many sites for TWS earphones, finally found great product under 5K price. It has very good sound clearity. It has decent deep bass which won't hurt your ears.(I won't recommend this for bass lover.) It is very easy to use. It does all the functions it mentioned. What i most like is the design of the earpods and its charging case. You'll definitely fall in love when you see it charging. It looks like Alien face.If you wish to invest 5K, then definitely these are yours.

Overall sound quality is very good. Bass is pure as compared to all other earbuds in this range. 100% purchasable product. Noise cancellation is very good. And they have very comfortable. I used them 6hrs continued but I didn't feel uncomfortable. No lag while playing PUBG or any other game which I like the most. Completely swetproof so you can use while running too. I used them while traveling my bike is at 60-70 speed range but they didn't feel off. My honest opinion buy them.

  Extremely poor. It's chinese piece  so its better to buy a normal Bluetooth earphone of JBL or Sony rather than go for a Chinese item that too at a higher price. The device refused to get connected to phones bluetooth device as it constantly wanted some pin which was earlier a 4 digit pin and later on its own became a 16 digit pin. I tried the usual pins btw i.e the default pins such as 0000 or 1234 but it didn't work. Moreover, the right earbud refused to switch on. I ordered a return of the item within 5 hours of its delivery. Very bad experience. on top of that Amazon was not accepting return even after processing the second defective piece twice. I have been trying to process the return since the day I received the defective earpods the second time. The return hasn't been processed even after two days now. Extremely poor service.

  The design of the charging case is very good, small and sleek. Could nicely fit in your pocket. The magnetic lid shuts flush and avoid dirt from going in. The earpods themselves stay in the charging case due to magnets and won't fall even if you shake while lid is open. The bluetooth connects quickly to a device already paired, but if you use 2 devices, you need to make sure only one has their bluetooth on while you start using the earphones, or they'll connect to either of them.My left earpiece is making an electronic buzzing sound, very low in volume but a bit irritating when I'm not listening to anything. I'm contemplating if I should replace them for such a small issue. Otherwise very good sound quality, decent loud for me, bass is good as well.

They could only be fixed after resetting the buds and re-pairing them.So I applied for a replacement.The sound quality was great in the replacement ones and I didn't face any volume issues.However, video calls get distorted or paused and this is because of these buds, I tried different checks to ensure it wasn't my device's fault. Absolute garbage when it comes to using them for video calls.The sound quality on calls is very bad, there is an echo, broken voice and an overall distorted call.I have used these for a week and they have let me down in various categories.Would not recommend at all. Do not waste your money.They're only good for listening to music, if that's what you're buying these for, then I'd give them a 4.5. The sound is balanced and is decent in even 50% volume.

    Good sound quality, cheap plastic case
  
","









  
  
    
  Pros::- Good bass sound. These are little on the heavy side of bass but there is a good balance between bass/treble and fair audio quality- Very easy to pair and connect. Once paired, the headphones get connected to your device within 1-2 sec- Good grip on ears. I use the headphones during workout,running and cardio routines. The headphones stay steady without movement and do not fall off your ears.- Very handy. You can carry this case in your front small pocket of your jeans.- Water resistant. I used this during rains in one of my runs. It worked fine for small water sprayed on it.Cons::- Very cheap quality plastic case. Might break/scratch if you drop it.- Hinge quality is poor. You can feel it that when you apply more than normal force while opening the case, hinges might break.

  I brought this 2-3 weeks ago and was just checking to see if its returnable.The products Bluetooth range is very limited. The moment you move few feet away from the phone, sound becomes distorted or disappears altogether.Also, the touchpads cover the entirety of the earphones,  it has happened with me several times that i was just taking out the earphone and the call got disconnected because my fingers pressed lightly on the button by mistake.These days I am experiencing issue with call volume also as the person on other line is not able to hear my voice, though not sure how much of that is attributable to network.Overall an okay product but i would suggest spending a bit more and buying a better quality product.

  Never waste your money on this product, don't trust reviews on internet, they are just a toy, even the charging cable that came with them don't fit it. Sound is worst, connection is even worse and forget if you want to make phone calls. JUST DONATE 2000 RUPEES TO SOMEONE IN NEED BUT DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE WORST PRODUCT I EVER CAME ACROSS. I am an audiophile, and order every product that comes out, but after watching fake paid videos on you tube where people praise this cheap product, or any cheap product that is made in china and marketed by Indian companies is total scam. Spend couple of thousand more and always buy product of international brands. All these companies are operating from Gurgaon, they only spend money on ads and give you tubers money to praise their products. Don't get into these scams.

  This is my first true wireless earpods. I was really impressed with size of this.  It fits well in my ears. If you want to listen to music this is a good device. About Noise cancelation the person on the other side of your call is going to be hearing all the surrounding noises in your vicinity. One issue that was experienced is the right earpod wasn't connected and was mute for a while. This problem was solved by placing both earpods in the charging case and pressing the capacitive button simultaneously so that the it lights up together.

I guess quality of Mi products generally has come down.Updaet 20 May 2020I would rate 2/5 for the product. As a big fan of Xiaomi, my expectation for the product was huge. This didn‚Äôt meet my expectations. Wired headphones of Xiaomi performs way better. Also there are many competitors currently in the market with better features and design. Please take care of this in the next release.Pros:1. Good Audio Quality.2. Excellent Call Quality. ENC works well.3. Good Battery Backup4. Works with iPhones too. Volume level is less compared to that on Redmi devices5. Reconnects instantly after opening the case.Cons:1. Poor Design. Stem is pretty thick. Should have been a lot slimmer.2. Average Build Quality. Hinges are not so strong. Can easily break if it falls down.3. Auto Pairing / Battery Opening Animation not showing on Redmi Devices. Tried on Note 5 Pro, Note 4.4.

  Its my honest opinion with True Wireless earphones, i have used many, and i have purchased mi true wireless earphone 2, i have good mobile device too, if you use wifi at home then this Mi True wireless earphone 2 can create huge problem, Since it uses LHDC it uses more resources from your mobile device and hence the wifi speed will be significantly reduced. To the ones who dont know wifi and bluetooth works on 2.4 GHz and hence when you connect any earphones of bluetooth 5.0 then your wifi speed will be reduced, once using mobile data can go for it. Sound quality is very good. Only i felt that touch controls are not very responsive.

I surely recommend this product to anyone easily.But one thing is there will be a slight lag when it comes to gaming. Which in general a problem for all TWS earphones.

  Edit: Right side earbud stopped working, not even a month and the product failed. Do not buy this, I thought it was premium product but it turned out to be a huge blunder for me..This is going to be in-depth review, I have been using these Air Dots 2 for a week now and oh boy they are excellent.TL;DR Not recommended for a bass head person, And the quality and bass mostly depends on your device. And sound quality depends whether the phone supports LHDC or not.Overall Ratings:  4.5/5Voice calls: 4/5Design: 3.5/5Music: 3/5Connectivity: 5/5Battery: 4/5Touch action accuracy: 3.5/5Overview: The first glance of these earbuds was pleasant. The box has a Matt finishing which I prefer. But there is no black variant of these earbuds, that is disappointment for me. The case contains two earbuds instead of them packed separately like Chinese version of these air dots 2. Also, there was a short Type-C cable to charge the case but due to its short length, I am going to use my phone charger instead. Connection to my phone was easy and straight forward. There was no big hassle connecting these earbuds to each of my phone. Though these earbuds can only work with one device at a time, So if you are a person who likes their Bluetooth wireless earphones connected to multiple phones, this would be a downside for you. One thing I noticed that the hinges in the case are kind of fragile, But this doesn't mean it will fall apart. Just don't drop your case on hard surfaces and it will be fine.Now, talking about the earbuds, They are made of plastic. And hardly noticeable while wearing them. Both of these earbuds has sound feedback when you put them in your ear. There is also alerts for disconnection from phone and Low battery. These earbuds have infrared Proximity sensor, which helps it to pause the media playback when either of earbud taken out of the ear, and resumes the playback when put back into ear. This is a handy feature for me at office and home. Earbuds hardly weighs and doesn't drop out of your ears accidentally even after shaking your head. Seriously, it fits very well.- Voice Calls: Voice calls are great,  The speakers are loud enough during calls and the Environmental Noise Cancellation works good, Though it could have been better. But at this price segment I can't complain more. Moreover, I saw a lot of people complaining about low volumes, That is purely based on their device they are using these earpieces with. I also really liked the single piece connectivity. Which means you can put one of these earbuds in the case and the other in your ear for calls. These earbuds can connect one at a time and both at a time.- Design: Xiaomi tried to copy Apple AirPods and design of these earbuds have similar looks to AirPods. Earbuds have block like design and has Matt finish on it.  The case is handy and not huge. It fits in my palm completely. Case also has Matt finish and has flip lid with magnetic connection. Lid magnets are strong so you don't have to worry about accidental openings. Also, the magnets for earbuds in the case are strong. Even after shaking the case upside down, earbuds won't fall off the case. You have to pull them to remove them. Overall design looks good, Though white color is disappointment for me but there is no black variant of this product is available. So be it white then.- Music:  Well, I am not much of a bass head myself, Though I listen to Rock, EDM and other genre, but bass is not a top priority for me. These earbuds have not that bad bass performance as other reviews are stating.  Content listing is just great with these earbuds, volumes are pretty much loud enough and sound doesn't distort even when set to 100%. But sound does leak when you set it beyond 70%. So if you are blasting music on full volume the person beside you might be able to hear the music coming out of them. But it is mostly unnoticeable unless you are in super quiet environment.The bass and quality of music largely depends on the device you are using. But if you are not a power user and bass is your priority, These might not be a good option for you. Go for Oppo or Realme true wireless earbuds if you want to.Though, If you are familiar with Viper4Android, It truly brings best out of these earbuds, specifically in Bass. If you are power user and uses Viper, You can get enough bass to satisfy your hunger of bass.- Connectivity: Being equipped with Bluetooth 5.0, These earbuds has decent range for connectivity. Though if you do live or work where there are thick walls all around, you might face some connection trouble. But in my testing it was fine in the other room. There is not much about to talk about the range of these earbuds they are just regular BT 5.0 earbuds with decent range. But connection to the device is quick as roadrunner. Just in 2 seconds of opening the case it gets connected to the device.  You can connect these buds individually. And even wear them individually if you prefer to.- Battery:  Battery backup of these earbuds was nearly 3 and half hour at 60-70% of the volume listing to music and podcasts. It is almost as same as any other earbuds in the market right now. Case can charge your earbuds for around 3 times at max. You will see the light on the case blinking when it's low on juice. Battery backup is up to the mark for the price segment. It satisfies me. Although they could have packed more power to the case so it could go more than 3 charges. But it doesn't matter much since case can charge full in around 45 minutes. I just charge it when I am using the earbuds. So no complaint from my side.- Touch action accuracy: Double tap to left earbud triggers Google Assistant or Alexa. Which is a handy feature for making calls, taking notes, saving reminders and what not. Double tap to right side of earbud triggers Play/Pause action when playing media. But accuracy of these earbuds would be improved. Maybe I did not get used to these touch actions but sometimes I have to double tap twice to do either of the actions.PS: You can change left side earbud double tap action to anything you want with help of MacroDroid app.Finally, These earbuds are good for my use-case, Battery backup is nice, Music quality is decent and so does connectivity.I would strongly recommend these for anyone looking for nice budget true wireless earbuds that excels in every area one might look for with considering price obviously.I also saw some people comparing it to Apple AirPods, Come-on don't compare 4000 INR product with whooping 13000 INR product. AirPods cost almost thrice in compare to these Air Dots 2.I will update this review if anything bad happens in upcoming days or months.Thanks for reading, have a good day.

    Confused with all the options around?  Take a moment and read this!

  This is a two-part review. In the first part I'll be comparing TWS (true wireless earphones), wired bluetooth earphones as well as conventional wired earphones. In the second part, I'll be sharing my review of these earpods solely based on comaprision with other TWS earbuds. Hope it helps you to make an informed decision.Comparision:Of the three types of earphones available in the market (not including headphones since they're a different breed altogether), let me say first and foremost that the wired neckband style bluetooth earphones make the most sense to an average indian consumer like you and me. Thats it, review's done.Oh wait! Whay are you scrolling for TWS earphone reviews then!? Let me take your 2 minutes of reading time by helping you put your hard earned money on the right product.TWS earpods: Like this one. The current trend that is riding on the wave started by apple ""oh so expensive"" airpods. Yes I too, thought it would be a flop but was proven wrong. Should you buy it then? Yes and no.No, if you are a music afficionado (not just a listener, a music freak), these are not very useful for you. If you do listen to music for short periods of time, the JBL, 1more and blaupunkt options are perfect for you.No, if watching videos is your main requirement. Even the ones with the low latency mode built in, are impractical.No, if you are a gamer, for the latency issues.YES, of you like me are someone who wants it mainly for calls and occasionally for listening to podcasts, music or watching a video for a short while.YES, if you, like me get calls while on the move. I just keep it in the box and as soon as I get a call, just flipit-stick it and tap it to pick it up.Wired bluetooth earbuds (usually with a neckband) give you atleast 12 hours of use on a single charge, are better in terms of latency (the vocals being heard a short moment after you see the lip movement on the screen) if not perfect. They are harder to lose and half the price of the cheapest decently specced TWS earbuds. ( I would recommend the Oneplus Z wireless or if you want to save a bit of money the realme buds or if you still want to save a bit more money, boat's unit).These make the most sense in terms of being practical and value for money but they do have the wire component and the battery component, both of which are the main problem creating parts of the other two.As for wired earphones, the lack of headphone jacks, is the reason many of us are opting for the other two. If you have a phone with a headphone jack, my advice would be to buy these without worrying about anything else. The worst that happens to them is problems with the wire which causes loss of sound in one ear ( 90% of us may have such heaphones!). Condidering the price difference, buying a new one also will not burn a hole in your pocket (unless you buy an AKG, top of the line earphones or others of that sort)Coming to the second part of the review, I chose these earbuds over the others because of (in order of preference)1. Battery life: Yeah, I said it! But since I'm comparing it to the other TWS earbuds only, these earphones have the perfect balance between the 'box's' charge and the 'earpod's' charge.2.Form factor: Yes they are bigger than most other TWS buds especially the realme buds air (which, are just a blatant copy of the airpods). I got used to it though and it's just a personal choice to have it stand out as something different yet usable.The earphones-without-a-wire look os perfect for those making calls and it is quite good in doing that. The Bud-style JBLs and other options though good, are not better than this for that purpose.The in-ear bud design, though firm and steady in the ear is not something I like especially while wearing it for a relatively longer time especially while walking or exercising, which is why these are better, sturdy enough and loud enough for a majority of the users.3. Charging: It has fast charge, which makes more sense. It has type-c charging, which also makes more sense and it does NOT have wireless charging like the realme buds air. But let's face it, many of us don't have wireless chargers and even if we do, speed always trumps ease.4. Price: Hear me out! I bought it during the introductory offer and only bought it because my card's cashback points allowed me to buy it without using the whole amount in 'conventional' money.Bottom line: Would I spend 4499 on these earphones? Not exactly. I just used a good amount of amazon pay cashback. If you can spare this amount for a TWS earphones though, these are worth buying over the realme buds air because of the battery life, over the JBL buds because of the better mic positioning (and the resulting call quality) and finally over the costlier options (the fruit company! ) because of the value that it brings.

    Good TWS with excellent LHDC implementation
  
","









  
  
    
  Earphones work perfectly with my K20 Pro. Initially the gestures weren't working but after resetting it, everything was resolved. The major flaw in this earbuds are the supposedly superior LHDC codec which works like trash on this. I have tons of FLAC and WAV files and on LHDC mode it was skipping songs for few seconds every now and then. If turned off, it reverts to AAC which is still fine and works great. Noise cancellation is non-existent and it's the drawback of such design choice. Comfort is OKish and they stay in ear despite the semi in ear design.Edit- 03/07/20After MIUI 12 update, the LHDC is shining like diamond. The clarity and instrument separation is on another level and no more skipping. Totally worth it.

  Absolutely incredible product by Xiaomi once again!!!I was completely blown away by the product from the time I opened it.Had a little trouble getting it paired to my phone, but once I got it connected it works like a charm.Pros:1. Easy connectivity: After connecting for the first time, all you have to do is open the case. The earphones connect within seconds and you're ready to play! Unbelievably fast! And put it back in the case and close it to power off.2. Range: I walked around the house a bit with the earphones on and didn't lose connectivity unless there was more than 1 wall in the way.3. Features: The open to connect feature is surely great and so is the remove earbud to pause feature. Note: this feature works by a proximity sensor, so even if you hold your finger in front of the sensor, it will sense that it is in your ear. Not a drawback, but worth mentioning..4. Battery: I have been using for a day now and have had no issues with battery life. So that's great.5. Sound quality: One of the main selling points of any audio device and the MI TWS 2 does not disappoint. The audio was very rich and sounds amazing. The bass was pretty satisfactory to me. Even if you want more bass, equaliser settings are a tap away from settings.Cons:The earphones don't have too many cons.1. The touch feature doesn't always work for me and I guess it would take a decent amount of time to master it.2. Wireless charging could have been appreciated but i guess considering the cost, you can't ask for much more.3. Ik some people are saying latency is a huge issue on these earphones for games, etc. but I'm not a mobile gamer, so no problemo!!!Conclusion: I would totally recommend anyone to get these earphones when they're at 3999.

  Pros:Value for MoneyGood for making calls, don't need to raise voice to be audible.Good Battery Life.Noise cancellation works well only on GSM calls in cancelling Air Thrust, Traffic Sound(not the honking).Sound quality is clear, its more towards High Note(Voice & Treble), Bass is okay.Cons:Noise cancellation doesn't work on internet calls, eg, Google meet, zoom, whatsapp etc., It echoes too.Its designed for People with small ear, actually the TWS2 stem is thick and fitted in the middle of TWS2, if it could've been placed differently than it could fit in well(snugfit) to normal or big ears.No volume buttons on TWS2.Call/Audio sound is good when Volume is above 70%, its okay from 40%-70% but its way poor below 40% volume(especially for calls).

Nice and clear sound quality  though latency is not low but OK, Bass is perfect and is as desired. Giving 4 stars only for 2 reasons ...Some more work needs to be done on  Noise cancellation i.e. from here to there and not from there to here :-)  The other party should not hear sound of others in the room than only us ....

    Excellent performance...
  
","









  
  
    
  It has a flat frequency response, which is common among branded high quality audio systems. Because sometimes it does not sit properly in the ears, the lower frequency performance (bass) goes down, some compensation for that would have been nice. Otherwise, all instruments of a good quality music, as well as speech, are clearly audible, which was not the case with many other ear phones I had. I listen only music from Fiio music player, I am not concerned about anything else. Another thing is ease with which Bluetooth connects, no need to be tech savvy at all. In addition, battery charges in 1 hour and lasts 6 days (average 1hr 30min/day), with the case.

  Got a defective product. One ear pod wasn't even proper. Not sure what's wrong with Amazon. Last time I ordered with Amazon pantry, I received one overpriced product and two expired ones.And after some cumbersome calls they have made justice by refunding.One hell of an experience.Waiting to see how they will cover up the story this time. Guys try to purchase on mi. com if it's for this item as there have been some customers reporting they got damaged products on Amazon as mentioned in the reviews. I overlooked assuming that's a rare scenario.

  Great things in small packages. Excellent sound quality (in the price range), comfortable build (for long meetings), good battery life and premium looking. Completely worth the money you put in. Did not fall or loosen at any point (yoga, tossing/turning in the bed). If this is your budget then go for it as you wont find anything better currently.

  Since i have a POCO , i thought it would be fit perfect without those animation like ipods. wow pretty amazing huh. i Guess the amazing part stops right there..let me get straight to the point.1. majorly i needed for calls to attend wfh meetings. and to be honest it solved my requirement. Call clarity was good, other person did not complain of disturbance. I had my celling fan running at top speed ,making sound of Mclaren , even then it pretty much killed external sounds and gave clear voice quality and clarity.2. Battery was average, it came around 2.5hrs3. Sound quality is good as well.Now comes the crazy part, after 20days of usage that too normal use, left one stopped working. now i was like What the Heck. i went through my work with the right one for time being. now right one stops charging and battery level is zero even after recharging with case and charging dock for 24 hrs. Pretty Amazing isnt it.service centers are as pathetic as they get. Avoid MI accessories, this isnt the first time i faced these issues with electronic accessories with MI. i guess when the crowd pulling your devices right and left, who cares.Pls for the sake of your hard earned money, BE AWARE.

    Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones
  
","









  
  
    
  Wireless music listening is the next generation style for the music freaks! In the world of headphones or earphones wires, wireless earphones or headphones gives us the freedom for a hassle-free wireless experience. Today I'm going to review the newest product in the audio family i.e. the Mi True Wireless Earphones 2.HISTORY OF BUYINGI have decided to buy the Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 on the very first day of its launch. But due to the current pandemic situation, mi.com & amazon.in was unable to add my location in the deliverable area. But after the Local Government new circular of resuming service of the online market portal; I managed to place an order through amazon.in in a special introductory price of 3999/-. The delivery is quite fast based on the current situation due to the pandemic situation. Just received the package today and just amazed by the product quality and design.TECHNICAL DETAILSFirst thing first; technical specification matters for all of us, right? Following are the details from mi.com. Don't worry you will get the same in the product.Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewDrive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewUNBOXINGAfter the package delivered, I've quickly opened it to experience the new. Following are some images of my inexperienced unboxing clicks.Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A Review Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A Review Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewDESIGN & LOOKSI was amazed to see the design of the product; how good looking the product the white colour Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 is. White coloured shinning box equipped with wireless buds.The charging case is made up of ABS plastic, due to which it is lightweight, The charging case has a matte finish making it less prone to scratches to its surface. Oval shape finishing at the edges makes it more trendy. It is perfectly fine to carry it in the pocket. Xiaomi branding logo can be seen only backside of the charging box.Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewDrive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewThe earbuds are also made up of ABS plastic, due to which each earbud almost featherweight. The earbuds feature half in-ear design with a matte finish similar to the case. No logo is there in the buds itself. But the left & right has been marked with ‚ÄúL ‚Äú& ‚ÄúR‚Äù.Drive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewDrive into world of Wireless Music : Mi True Wireless Earphones 2 - A ReviewCONNECTIVITY & CONTROLSOne-click connect is available for devices with MIUI. Just open up the box lid and press the function button in the right side of the case and all set to pair it with my device with Bluetooth v5.0 technology. For the non-MIUi based devices, it can be paired by pressing the function button some moment; after the white LED  in the box the blinking then it is all set to pair it with my non-MIUI based device. It also connects my Macbook super easy.Gesture control across all the devices are also pretty impressive. Double tapping on the right earbud leads to play and pause music. Voice assistants like Siri and Google assistants can be accessed by double-tapping the left side bud. For taking calls double tapping on any of the earbuds works smoothly.Smart In-ear detection enables the music playback to automatically pause when I take them off and resumes when I put them back on.SOUND QUALITYThe Mi True Earphones 2 equipped with 14.2mm composite diaphragm dynamic driver which produces immersive HD sound. For checking the sound quality I have chosen some tracks based on Base, Vocals and Electronic Music.The track Sadness by Enigma gives all the combinations to test the earphones. Base drums, vocals, electronic elements are perfectly fine and give a good feel to my ears. Also tried some of the HipHop Tracks along with some classical sitar tracks; in which beats and tunes of sitar feels good in my ear canals.CALL QUALITYThe Mi True Earphones 2 comes with Dual-mic Environmental Noise Cancellation that cancels ambient noise and provides a clear voice clarity during calls. I have made some calls with some of the fellow Mi-Fans, relatives and even with office colleagues; everyone heard my voice just loud and clear, feeling like I am calling like using without any handsfree. Double-tap while taking calls works perfectly for me and gives a wire-free call experience.

  Using this product from last 3 months. I have redmi phone so purchase it in first sale due to better compatibility with MIUI but that feature is not supported in Redmi phone.Call quantity: Purchased it for office calls, this is good for calls but do not last more than 1.5 to 2 hours.Sound: is good but not like a 4000‚Çπ device.Issues:1- Right side bud have less sound, tried resetting it many times but no success.2- battery backup is max 2 hours and box is also not worth of charging as need to charge it daily.Do not know it is my device or other have same issueI am also using boat rockers 255 and I m very much happy with it.

  Should you get this? Common questions answered1. If you are an audiophile and have used earphones that cost 20x or 10x as much? Then, the answer is obviously NO.2. If you have seen the Apple Airpods and want a cheaper alternative to them: YES, YES!3. Is the call quality OK? In a room, YES. Outside: Stay tuned for updates.4. Package rating overall: 4/5I would have bought this if I knew they sounded so nice. Understand that I have used Bose and Apple in-ear earphones since 2003/2009 respectively, so I kinda know what nice earphones sound like. I would still buy it because almost for the price of earbud tips for my bose (3120 INR), i can get a set of wireless earphones that ACTUALLY WORK. Bose has dozens of issues and is the main reason why I switched to Airpods5. Bass: I am not a bass head, the bass in this is FINE for my music type. I listen to classical/acoustic/heavy metal. All 3 genres sound nice on these.If you wish to read further, be my guest. If you think this is enough for you, buy it! Now!Initial impressions -- First hour of usageSo I just got my earphones. I have been using Apple Airpods, but my problem is that they do not work too well with my Android device which I use for calls because of the massive battery.The bad:1. Wee bit bigger than the airpods. they kind of fit my ear completely, so just minor amounts of pain, but that is just adaptive and you can avoid it by moving it around a bit. the same as getting cheap earphones.2. The sound quality is a bit iffy compared to the airpods or my bose earphones. To put things into perspective, i am taking a scale of 1-10.Bose: Sound quality: 10/10Apple AirPods: Sound Quality: 8/10Mi earphones: Sound Quality: 6/10Samsung in-ear wireless earphones: 6.5/10Understand that the score of 6 means that 90% of the people will LOVE these.3. Out of box experience: battery was 10%4. This is the only ""problem"" per se. These fall out when you tap on them unlike the airpods, but only an issue when on the move.5. Battery on one side gives up faster than the battery on the other side. (10% difference in discharge rate)The good:The good bits are many1. great, cheap alternative to Apple Airpods. 3x lower price--3600 vs 14,0002. sound is great for the price, equally loud on droid and iOS3. they fit well and do not tend to fall out while walking/running. I will post a cycling trip update later in the day4. call sound quality is decent, even in a moderately noisy room. IDK about the noisy room bit because we're in a lockdown situation, and I have not tried using these while the tv was on.What I like the most:1. Unlike my bose in-ear phones, they do not completely block out sounds, which is what I like about my AirPods too. I HATE in-ear earphones while out cycling/walking, they make me dizzy. They also do not have the dozens of issues I have with my Bose in-ear earphones.2. sound is loud enough on all platforms.I will keep on updating this review as I continue to use this product further.

  I ordered this to replace my trandition ear phones after being recommended by a friend. Unfortunately the product that was delivered to me is not as I heard about it. Not living upto the clains is one things, apart from that, the ear pieces work alternately most of the time. Sometimes it also fails to work. The BT range is not more than 5 to 6 ft. The quality of sound is very poor on phone calls.. sudden static is heard and it appears the callers voice is shivering, but works better with music. Battery life is barely 2 hrs to 3hrs at a stretch and then charging is required which is fairly fast. For this price and the quality it provides,this ear phone is a very bad choice.

  Felt bit high priced when I bought it for 4k in July, 2020. Sound quality is okay ‚Äì but could have been much better compared to the cost. What irritated me is that my ear hurts after more than 30 mins of usage. Have used other brands too but never faced such issues. Xiaomi support claims that their headphones are made with a standard size which i dont' disagree but my right ear hurts and that's what i know.

    Best TWS for calling and music
  
","









  
  
    
  This is one of the best TWS under 3500.I don't know why so many users are spreading negative reviews here, music from these tws was awesome and you will get a great call quality in this price range. I have taken lots of calls but no one complained about disturbance and even they didn't identify that I am using TWS.Pros1. Very light weight2. Awesome music experience (you may have audio leakage bcoz this is not complete in-ear type)3. Great call quality(I have used while riding on my bike it completely removed air noise but the other person can hear environmental noise around you but your voice will not muffled)4. Battery backup( I have tested and on continuous music it gave me around 3.5 hours in 90% volume) calls I didn't tested.5. Nice build quality6. Fast charging, you can charge your case and tws in 1 hour7. Perfectly fits in ear (for 90% of people)If your ears are big then this is not for youCons1. Ugly design especially the stems are goofy2. I noticed connectivity issues, while you listen to music if you get a call sometimes voice is not coming from tws, at that time you have to turn off Bluetooth and turn on.This is not every time(4 times out of 10)3. Sound leakage ( if you listen music at 80% the person next to you can enjoy your music)4. The hinge of the case is not that durable5. Not for gamingVerdictIf you want best tws for calling and music you can pick this blindlyNote : Every device has its own pros and cons, Finally you have decide which suits your requirements.

  Honestly speaking after using it more than one week, I realised that sound quality is good but not so impressive, noise cancellation function is not working so well since it doesn't have active noise cancellation function and battery life in the TWS is good and no complaint about the battery. Since it's having two mics in each, in my unit, I faced the problem of double voice was heard by other side...on calling, I having loudness and but problem of double voice being heard by other side.

  Noise cancellation DOES NOT WORK. While on call, the party on other side can hear all nearby sounds highly amplified. Even smallest of the sounds like keeping something on table, TV in another room etc are heard highly amplified on the other end of the line. In today's COVID scenario, we are trying to avoid contact with people by buying online, but companies are manufacturing POOR QUALITY stuff & then asking to go to service centers to get it fixed, thereby increasing contact.For 4000 price range, totally PATHETIC product with poor quality & even poorer customer service.

LHDC is great but also uses more battery..no way to check battery percentage properly..Can't comment on battery since I returned it because it was not comfortable for me,but that differs from person to person..Also check of your phone supports LHDC otherwise you won't be able to use LHDC codec.

  If you're interested in a piece of cheap TWS which is dependable software, has above average to great audio and comes at a low cost, this is the device you should most definitely buy!PROS:1) Superb Sound Quality for the price.2) Instantaneous pairing with Redmi/Mi Devices.3) Battery life exactly as advertised. 4hrs on the dot for the buds and another 8hrs on the case.4) USB C so you don't need a new to scramble for a Micro Usb charger. Your phone charger works fine and it also support quick charge! 0-100 in around 40-45mins.5) Call quality is extremely good. Other person on the call couldn't even tell I was using earphones.CONS:1) Audio quality quickly degrades at higher volume level.2) Bass is sub-par despite having such large drivers.3) Product quality control issues all around. Case hinge is too loose and rocks when pushed slightly with thumbs, the ear buds still had some residual glue/dirt when I got it. (See picture)4) No dedicated App for controlling music Profile/EQs/Seeing charge levels.5) Battery life could have been better.6) No Qi charging unlike the RealMe ones which come at Rs. 500 cheaper.7) No low latency mode unlike the RealMe ones and even their own Redmi Earbuds which come at less than Rs. 2000 bucks.8) Uncomfortable for long term wear (Greater than 1.5hrs). Wish it came with eartips.

  Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bassJust at the low volume its a bit too soft need to keep the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel. Distance from the phone pretty much 10 or 15 meter later it get a bit faded. Looks too good permium quality the led lights on the CTC ( capacitive touch control ) . The fit is too good if any problems you feel its a bit loose change the ear tips. It fits really well in helmets but an advice do not use both together while riding a bike you literally can't hear much . The CTC button is too sensitive but need to get used to it.The colour variant is too catchy really nice. I was expecting a big charging case but when I saw it was so small like literally fits ino your palm.Iys has magenetic charging so your airdope dont fall off and the lid is magnetic so it wont open unecssarily. Its has a C type charging port thats one great thing done by boAt since most of the phones have C type charging port  you wont have to search for a charger. I just got it today still need to play around with it will update in a while . Overall great product ,only the volume at the low which does'nt sound great needs a bit fix but thumbs up great product must buy.And great delivery and packaging by Amazon.

    Best buds in the budget with Type C
  
","









  
  
    
  I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.3. Select Feat. JBL E1+4. Open Preset options5. Select Blues and Voila!! üéØFor other phones -I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! üôÇHappy Listening! üé∂

  Got these in the Amazon Prime Sale. Was not sure what to expect as I have been on the lookout for  tws for quite sometime. Wanted to buy a Made In India product but I guess that wish cannot be fulfilled at this moment as these are also sourced from  PRC.  As for the overall build quality they are good and offer iPx7 water resistance. Needed something for my running needs as I sweat a loot and all my earbuds died out because of the sweat. Since these were delivered yesterday I used them today in my morning run. The fit is extremely good and satisfy all my needs. Had worn them for close to 1 hour 15 minutes and not even once did they get loose. The fit was perfectly fine. As for the battery in 1 hour the battery charge came to 80% from 100 with a  volume of around 65 to 75 % on my One Plus. You need to use a slightly higher volume to enjoy them. Not that the volume is low but then I had to use it at that percent. So a full charge would go for 4.5 to 5 hours at the max with continuous listening but then who listens music for that long a time. Also the sound quality is more towards the bass side. With higher volume the bass becomes too high and as such I did not enjoy it.  Boat should have balanced that out. As for the battery bank it is huge and the airdopes get's charged extremely fast. The airdopes were charged from 70% to 100% in less than 15 minutes. Overall happy with them just wish the bass was a bit more controlled.#### Update 11th Aug:Have been using them regularly since they were delivered i.e the 8th. The battery percentage on the storage has reduced to 75% after using it for almost 4 to 5 hours daily since then. The  earbuds are very secure in fit probably the best if you would like to use them during your workout. Though I would have to buy a new set for 2 phone connectivity during my drives as they do not support dual phone connectivity. Till now very satisfied with them. Also would like to add that the touch in there pods are very accurate.#######Update 14 Aug:1. Since 8th when I got the case to 100% charged I haven;t recharged them as yet and the battery is still holding to around 50% +2. Have been using them for 2 to 3 hours on daily basis3. The earlier review was on using the airdopes on amazon music. Since then I have used youtube and ganna to hear the songs and found that they are more balanced and loud when playing songs from ganna or youtube than from amazon music. I use my one plus at around 50 to 55% when listening songs on Ganna and youtube. not sure if this is just in my mind.4. Another thing that I have observed is that one in while say 2 to 3 times a day the left airdopes would disconnect for an instance and then connect back immediately. I have been observing this almost on a daily basis. Hope these last for some time and hope that the left ones do not give away.5. I increased the volume to 100% on my phone to check on the battery and the battery on the airdopes went to 70% in approx a hour however with 65% to 75% of the volume it had gone down to 80% from 100% in an hour.6. Another plus point of the big  battery storage case is that it charges the airdopes super fast.########### Update - 22 Aug 2020 after 2 weeks of usageAfter two weeks of usage below are the updates:Pros:1.  Battery backup in case is very good. With usage of aprox. 1 to 2 hours every day the case is still holding approx 40% of charge even after 2 weeks. Very good option for people who travel for say 2 to 3 hours in a day in public transport.2. The earbuds can easily continuously work for 4.5  hours at a stretch without requiring a recharge3. The earbuds charge at a very fast rate because of a high battery capacity of the case4. Earbuds are good to listen to the songs and who ever is a fan of bass can easily go for these.5. The Build quality of the case and ear buds are descent.6.  At least I find the fit of the earbuds very comfortable and do not have issue wearing them. I use for my runs which last for approx 1 hour and never had any issues. This is a personal preference.7. There is no noise cancellation but the fit of the earbuds is such that it automatically stops all the external noise.Cons:1. I happen to loose  Bluetooth connection once in a while while using them. This is more for the left earbud than the right side.2. These are not good for phone calls. The call quality is not good and the  person on the other side faces issues listening to me.3. Since I use these on multiple devices. I have to manually make it connect when I change the device even if the Bluetooth is active on one single device.I have not been hearing any static noise as few have been complaining. Also I need to check how much time it takes to charge the case.

  I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441.  Also, the sound quality is best. But this noise has made me dislike the product. Sorry. Returning it.

  Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.Pros:1. Great Sound Quality2. Great Bass3. Great Battery Life4. Fast ChargingCons:1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.

  From the first look, they really looked very nice. I bought the red colour, and the red colour pops-up really nice.They Charging Case is also very nice looking.I wore them for a few minutes, and my ears started hurting.The fitting is going to be different for each user, depending on the size of their years and their comfort.Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass.For people who would like to use it for official or personal calls, will feel that you will Sound robotic to the other person.There is also a delay in voice-over, which I think it‚Äôs not that bad.The noise cancellation is not there at all.These are much better than a few of similar products available in the market. However, it will be to each user to choose these based on their comfort level as well as their pocket.

  * It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.* Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive* The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.* I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.* While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.**** Batteryüîã review (after 2 weeks)Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6¬Ω hrs.Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT.

    Must buy if you are a basshead
  
","









  
  
    
  If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month,  3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.Battery Life: 4/5Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids  are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :)

  I am really having such a bad experience using this Boat Airdopes 441 product. I ordered it on 10th June 2020. It's  28th and my left ear buds gets discharge in less than 10 minutes. I tried everything possible to cure the problem. I am not able to even factory reset it. The seller  has closed the window of return. It's my third Boat's product but I am having really tough time with this third one. I don't know what to do. Product is under 1 year warranty but does it worth having a product which cannot even work properly for 15-20 days.

  Sound quality : Very good sound quality for the price, the bass, miss and highs are crisp and clear even when on full volume sound does not crack.Fitment : Fits perfectly well when using the correct earbud and hook size.I experienced a bit of pain when using for a long time but this depends on the type of ear.Full charge of the earbuds lasted me a good 6 hours of mixed usage of music and callsCall quality : I can hear perfectly but the other person hears a lot of environmental noise, please do not buy if your primary usage is phone / video callsGaming : There is a bit lag when gaming and watching videos.Overall a recommended product for good quality music and using while in the gym.Tested with iPhone 11 pro & asus 5Z with earbuds setup for my hearing and sound profile as Jaybird freedom

Yes, the mic is worse the other person will hear a hissing sound while on call, I tested this multiple times the mic is really bad.Another issue is you cannot connect it to multiple devices, only 1 device will be connected at a time, now imagine you have airdopes connected to the laptop and if you want to receive a call, you will have to reconnect the boat airdopes to the phone.And On Top of this, there is no refund available on a replacement.

    Customer service of BoAt sucks. I'm highly frustrated now.

  I'm writing this one, as a follow up to my previous review/feedback.After around 2-3 months of following up with the boat customer service and after the complaint with the National Consumer forum I received the replacement for my original faulty product.Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.üò† Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat. This time it took at least 3 weeks of time(which is okay with me as compared to the delay experience i had earlier) to get this faulty product replaced.Finally, I was happy with this 2nd time replaced product, everything in this one seemed perfect. But it has been just 15 days since I received the airdopes and now I find that the right ones battery gets exhausted within 15-20 mins after a full charge whereas the left one with the same amount of charge can run for more than an hour.I don't know what's wrong with this product or what's wrong with the Boat guys. This is literally frustrating for any customer. After replacing 2 times and waiting to receive a good product for more than 4 months of purchasing it still I'm hankering for it.All I wanted is to let you all know my experience with these airdopes. Now i literally realize that I wouldn't have purchased this product at all. I should have gone for some wired earphones which is far better than these or would have gone for some other company. I'm being cheated by Boat again and again.Customer service sucks... Neither they test a faulty product properly nor they test the one sending as a replacement. Then my question is why are they sitting over there?? Why they take so much of time to get us the replacement???

  Please avoid buying this as there is a constant hissing sound in the left airdope.

  So finally after returning 4 bluetooth earphones  üòú(I. E. Wings earbuds, Crossbeats Wave, realme earphones (which were actually fake from seller) and Sony xb55ap) I landed on to this amazing sound machine from Boat after checking reviews on many sites and YouTube. I am a audiophile and I needed the best earbuds/earphones at a budget of 3k atmost. After listening to music and checking call voice quality, here is my review :Pros :1. I was impressed with the BASS and clear sound quality after checking so many earphones and buds and you will never regret buying with these buds.2. The fit is perfect as they don't even feel like falling off.3. Bluetooth connectivity is very smooth and both buds are connected separately just after opening the case every time. (if any of the buds does not get connected automatically then don't worry at all,just press it for 3 seconds and it will be paired to the other bud.4. Battery life is good as I used it for 2+ hours and they were on 60% till then.5. They don't look big after wearing them like other earbuds.Cons :1. Case's build quality is ok but not sturdy.2. No noise cancellation at all, this should be taken into consideration by Boat.That's all from my end guyzzz!!!I am writing this review just to help those people who wants to enjoy their music with latest & affordable tech and great sound quality.

  Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go. Magnetic box is efficient for securing the earbuds. LED indicator is functioning properly.Cons: Brace yourself-Bluetooth connectivity lost arbitrarily in between music. Call quality is not upto the mark- sound is poor despite adjusting call volume, initial and end parts of a call are lost with almost no noise cancellation. No gesture or facility for volume control. With no buttons and only touch maneouvred gestures it is very difficult to adapt to listening music or calling for long hours. Gesture are congested and not user-friendly.Overall I would like to rate this a 3/5 for a budget bluetooth earphone.

  Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look. Initially I was too confused in chosing earbud. From xiomi to  crossbeats to sony, I planned for everything. Unfortunately all had negative n positive reviews. So went for a fresh product and writing the review after 1 hr of use.Sound n music quality is good. Built is premium. 2600 mah case, type C charging is best. Ipx7 is added in pro.I bought it for calling purpose and I tested indoor n no one could differentiate that I was calling from earbud. So thumbs up.Hopefully in long run the review holds true!

The connectivity is very fast and airdopes have a very nice backup and fast charging.Coming on sound quality, the sound is pretty balanced. It  has awesome base due to the 6mm drivers. Many eardopes also have 10mm drivers but the problem in them is that you will only hear the base and nothing else. But in these eardopes the instruments and vocals are pretty clear besides the boom base!! They provide a overall balance. Sometimes you may feel overbased but 95‚ÑÖ times the sound is balanced.The fitting is really very nice and they do not fall out of ears at all. It has very nice grip. Good for sports also.

Some other people have also reported the same.Basically Airdopes 441 and 441 Pro are same, just case and IP7 rating is different.The Case is heavy almost 3/4 weight of a phone and is big, but with larger battery capacity.If you are Ok with 15-18 hours backup go with just 441 to save money.However this is also worth a buy.

  I bought it on a discounted price of 2499.The Quality of the product is Good and the battery life on full charge goes up to 12hours. It also depend on the volume you use.After using a week i found that it was nit pairing one fine day then i got manual and Reset the air drops and it started working fine.It feels premiumIf compared to other air pods boat is Better then others . I have given it 4 stars for less Bass quality.I used it today when it was raining and it is still working. I have a Bose soundsport. And the only difference i found was bass and bose has Little better noise cancellation. For price range of 2500 this is the best Airdops / air pods

  Received brand new product but one Airdope was stoped woking suddenly. After reading user manual, I came to know that, I need to put that airdope in charging case. Then only it will work properly. But it happens frequently. Also base quality is not that much good as expected. Hence returned this product. Thanks Amazon for refund my money as usual on time. (Which takes time from Flipkart.)

  I would keep it short and pointed out:1. Connectivity is pretty nice - connects instantly on lid open.2. Seamless stereo/mono switch - works fantastic every time. No issues faced3. Build is pretty good - for the price, the build quality is really good. The LED is fantastic i must say4. Touch - the touch is just, well, too good. It takes up at any point, the slightest of touches and that MIGHT be irritating at times5. Sound - in one word, GOOD! Actually good is being really vague. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming. Bassheads will not be really sad with this. Instrument separation is good even though the mids are a little muffled. Pure vocal artists will lose the edge there. The punch will be really high in songs like Get Lucky, Madness etc. So yes, for this price point, the sound is good.6. Fit - perfect fit, doesn‚Äôt fall off. But sadly, very subjective, hurts my ears after 45 minutes or so. If your ears don‚Äôt hurt, go nuts doing any exercise you want.7. Passive noise cancellation - brilliant but with an underside of not hearing ANYTHING AT ALL from outside. So keep that in mind and do the needful when out wearing them.I cannot comment on the battery or long term issues. I have used it for my runs and casual listening. For the price, this is really a decent bud pair!!

  When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2999 and within days - it was priced at 2499.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. This was my first ever purchase with boAt I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 1499.

  COMFORT:I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.NOISE CANCELLATION:Don't have to worry about it wearing off easily üëçüèª. Noise cancellation is also great it blocks all the noise around you (fan, tv noises, etc...).BATTERY BACKUP:Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 8-10 days.MIC:My only concern is the mic, while on phone some people, on the other hand, have complained about my voice (too low and breaking) but it just may be because of my low volume speak, so anyone who have low pitch speaks you would have to speak a little louder.CAPACITIVE BUTTON:The touch buttons are too sensitive, so during a workout the song stop sometimes because of my shoulder or my shirt. Also during a call, if  I have to remove the ""AirDopes"" my hand would accidentally touch the capacitive button and the call gets disconnected (one solution to this is to first disconnect them from the phone first, then remove them).SOUND QUALITY:I have no complaints about the sound quality. The bass is PERFECT not too much (as seen earlier on older boat products, they fix it I guess).  The high and low are also clear.

  These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:1: Budget2: decent sound3: Good Bass4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 üåü rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.For me this was a major low  unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars.

  2 months of usage and previous unit replaced so updating the review.. the bluetooth issue is resolved in replaced piece, so overall it's a good product with balanced sound at good price if purchased under 2400*****Roughly 1 day of usage, bluetooth disconnecting soon as soon as u get little away from device.. or even when you use one earbud and keep other away with phone with you, it will cut u out.. that itself was worrysome but now I connected with my android set top box for TV viewing and it's not connecting constantly. Though TV is right in front of me 3m away. Even Boat rocker headphone I use otherwise works better than this.These things are not being told or checked in youtube reviews availble strangely, either they are paid reviews or they don't check thoroughly.Ear grip is good, sound is reasonable but when I was watching BBT on prime video, sound was relatively low. So overall it seems a good buy if u just want to use it in both ear with phone in pocket all the time or for some gaming. Call was disrupted too couple of times..Probably will return this unless Boat provides a solution to bluetooth issue.

  Opened the pack to find a cute earbud. Was impressed with ease of use. The plastic on the outside looks cheap, but felt comfortable on the ear. Good look for the price. Was very happy on the initial use of work call and music during work. Trouble started on day 2, when I used it for workout. Even a slight touch on the left pod starts iTunes. This was a big annoyance as I was listening to something off iTunes. Then tried connecting to my Android, but it wasn't pairing. On day 3, when I opened the case, the left pod wasnt charged and ran out of battery again soon. Returned it to get another box, which had left pod charging issues repeatedly. Ended up returning that too.

  Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks.

  I got it delivered yesterday.  Everything is good. But my left ear bud is having a technical glitch type sound while playing any music and it is very disturbing to the ears. But I have full faith on Amazon. I have requested for a replacement.  I have full faith that in my next delivery the problem will be fixed.It was a technical problem. Just a faulty piece maybe.

  Well for the first time I'm using the term ''disappointed'' for boAt but this time you people have failed to live upto the expectations.I had purchased boAt 441 on 15 June, 2020 which got delivered on 18 June,2020. My overall experience was okayish as the bass quality and the voice quality was pretty decent until today (28 June,2020).My audio device is not working as the person on the other side can not hear a word i say. The whole purpose of buying this headphone is defeated. Considering the work from home scenario I had purchased it to make myself comfortable while attending the 'n' number of calls I get; however, the comfort was short-lived. I hope I get a better replacement for this faulty device.

Like tr tr tr tr tr ..... when music is not playing.I figured it needed a factory reset, tried it. No change.Figured it could be external interference, tried it in open place and no change. It almost like they got quality control issue.Did a return and replace and new item is also same. I‚Äôm not sure if this is specific to black model or all models.

    Left earbud noise

  Bought the boat blue airdopes. Used it for 2days and it was working fine. But on the third day the connectivity started getting distorted even in the next room even with bending and moving. That was very disappointing. Also there was a constant tr tr tr.. noise in the left ear bud which is very low but it is noticeable. This noise only comes when the music is on. When the media stops playing the noise also stops. The voice calling is extremely poor. The person on the line will get a lot of background noise and the voice gets cracked, it was a very bad experience. So it is only suitable for listening to media. Ordered replacement. Hope the problem does not persist in the replaced model too.UPDATE : Got the replacement. The left bud noise is still there. It is lower than the previous pair. It seems like the problem persists in all products of this model. Think just have to ignore the noise.

  I am really impressed by boat's sound quality. Here is my observation about the product that includes its pros and cons:1. The most impressive fact is that the case unit is very compact and easy to carry.2. The bass quality is amazing for such small size. 10/10 for its bass.3. Treble could have been better, but it really depends on quality of mp3 song.4. Touch control is good but not great, it is an amazing feature but there is a finite lag in response.5. I wish that battery back up was more as I hate charging gadgets frequently. Battery back up is only average and there is definitely a lot of scope for improvement.6. This product is definitely better than its competitors in the market and at such reasonable price its definitely a ""go-go!!""7. The ear flag which is particularly provided in these ear buds only helps the buds to stay stable in the ear and they won't fall off while walking, exercising and jogging.8. A built in mic helps to answer calls.9. The ear buds can work as single piece/mono mode or together/stereo mode.

  Before this unit could reach me which I ordered on the first day of launch, I went through a few reviews which mainly has the complaint of audio quality with distortion at higher level of volume. I too felt the same but now after few more usages, I am feeling comfortable and hope this continues. I believe we have to give time for burn-in so that the earphones give the desired output. So, before reaching to any conclusion, we have to use it atleast for a 2-3 days.Call quality seems decent.Looks are great, built quality is good.The working pattern of these earbuds are quiet different and the best part is accident touch during call and music play does not interrupt our work since single tap does not disconnect the call or stop the music which is a very good feature.So, if the sound does not have disturbance as it had initially in the first few minutes, these could prove to be one of the best in the price bracket.

  This newly launched PTron Urban has lots of Pros and few Cons :Pros :1. Stylish case with leather look top with magnetic closure. Very sleek and stylish look.2. Sound quality is just awesome, very clear and loud and the high, mid and low notes are very clear.3. Bass is very deep and throbbing.4. Someone has given his opinion that, at 70% volume the Bass and sound quality deteriorates, which is absolutely wrong opinion. I am using it with my IPhone XS, and I have tested it at 80% volume to check it and found no distortion. However, the sound quality is so loud and clear that, I listen to songs and music at only 30% volume, which is very satisfactory even at night, when there is no outside noise, I need to reduce it at 20%.5. The USP of the product is the touch control and the volume control, which you will find only in the price segment of Rs. 5000/-.6. Call quality is also quite good, no complaint from the other side, who is calling or being called.Cons :1. I need to use the large size of the silicone tips and while using the large silicone tips provided in the box, I experienced pain after an hour. However, I had to replace the large silicone tips, with an extra set of large silicone tips available with me from PTron Tango.2. What has mostly disappointed me, is the battery back of the charging case. PTron claims a total music play time of 15 hours, which is 5 hours of play time of the bass buds and  5 hrs each for 2 more charging from the charging case. However, what I found that, after total play time of little more than 6 hours, the charging case is showing 25% of battery back up. This is very disappointing.Due to above 2 dislikes, I have given 4 stars.

Sound - right buds is awesome with respect price, left bud sound burstfull noise generated, hencee no use of left bud.6. Base - good but again left buds are worth no penny7. Touch activity - one easily feel the delay in response. But okish.8. Magnet - okay , n that good...might loose power with time soon9. Battery - yet to testWhen buds primary role is for decent sound and one of the bud is not working what is use of other features.I guess there is some production issue with left budsDo not recommend

  One of the worst products i ever used.I got lot of high and medium end headphones and earphones. I already got one bluetooth earphones from the same company. Thinking that this product also would provide similar kinda output, I purchased it right on the first day of prime sale. All my enthusiasm was gone right after i started using this product.I am not an audiophile but I got very good understanding on the products as I already own lot of them and i spend a lot on these devices.The sound is very cheap compared to any other device i used ever. This is the only i wanted to say about this product and wouldn't advise anyone to experience this. Think twice before you go for this.

  This product is a mess.... Only one thing I like about this product is the bluetooth distance that it covers and fits perfectly in ears compared to normal ptron bassbuds which I have used it's costly and the product does not justify its cost and Please don't buy this product...... Bass buds you would get it for thousand it has much better sound effect and there is absolutely no voice cancellation if you want one for calling never go with this product the name bass buds urban doesn't justify as there is no proper bass..... Overall very bad product for this range..... A clear no and thumbs down

    Must Read Review before u buy these TWS!!!!!!!!!
  
","









  
  
    
  This is the most genuine review by a customer itself.You must read it to know the truth behind TWS earbuds. Let's startDesign and handling -- it is perfect , it gives premium look and are comfortable in ears.Case  -- it is also awesome which gives it attractive look. At this price these TWS have the best design.But the case is not provided with on/off button .Sound quality -- It is average, 5/10Bass quality. -- Not upto the mark. 3/10.Noise cancellation -- It does not cancel any noise. While on voice call even ceiling fan voice is heard by other person, which is very disturbing.Battery -- earbuds battery last for 4 hrs .Case battery drains out quickly in one charge, you have to charge it 2-3 times in a day if you use it continuosly.Range -- It is pretty good(10 m). Sometimes there will be voice and sound cut while walking.Latency -- yes, you can find little delay in sound hear and on voice calls. Your voice will reach to other person with delay of 0.8-1 seconds.In short , it will be very difficult to get an excellent TWS earbuds in price range of 999-1700 but this earbud are very good compare to it's competitors at the same price range .If ur budget is btw ‚Çπ1100-1700 ,then this is the best TWS to buy because at this range you cannot expect much from TWS earbuds.

  Review of pTeon Bassbuds Urban -Got it today for 1299 during Prime day.Delivered next day after order.Most amazing thing about these earphones is its case. Its Metallic and high quality fibreBass - 9/10.Treble - 9/10Loudness - 8/10Call quality while calling - 9/10Design of earphones - 10/10Battery backup - 4 Hour (Left piece) + 4 Hour (Right Piece) - Total 10 Hours in 1 chargingCase will give extra full charging to both pieces for  2 Times.Why i did not buy Mivi / Boat / JBL / Realme or any other brand?1. Design quality is best in pTron2. Touch sensor is given in this while in all other brands Press button is given in this price range or is very high in price.If your range is below 2000, dont overthink and just go for it.This was my First purchase with pTron and also first TWS earphones.Best in class. Just go for it.

  I have ptron for over a 4 days now and put them to a difficult work directly from the beginning. I spent lion's share of my work days wilt in the workplace on the telephone or in the vehicle on the telephone (I sort out a ton while driving :) so pair of these were actually enormously refreshing. I go to the exercise center regularly and love tuning in to music during exercises. So here are my discoveries: Pros: - amazing sound quality both music and verbally expressed word - they are VERY tough - they sit consummately in my ears (I was somewhat suspicious from the outset and stressed that I will lose them yet genuinely, these are so all around made!) - you will soon totally overlook you are wearing the buds as they are truly agreeable - charging time is truly sensible and they last charged for a long time - the case is incredibly solid and little enough to easily fit in your pocket/tote Cons: - they accompany a charging link that is just not long enough. It doesn't influence how they work obviously however it is a touch of torment to charge in any case.

    Good looking case but bad usability with bad earbud's design.
  
","









  
  
    
  Bass is awesome but other brands ear buds also provide similar performance. Not much extraordinary performance. Design of buds is not good. Designers gave all the concentration to carrying case.There is a frequent problem with sync between the buds while watching any video and listening to the music. Battery backup of buds is satisfactory but carrying case needs charging frequently.Design beats usability. Case lid is locked magnetically. You have to have nails to open as the indentation to hold the lid to open is very small and it will be difficult for people with trimmed nails.  Also, controls are very confusing. Single tap in right/left to low/raise volume.  And more.I will not recommend this earbids to others. If have to buy earbuds I will look for other brands in the same budget.

    Amazing sound quality, Best TWS under 5000
  
","









  
  
    
  I have been using TWS by oppo, and Mi, but I must say that these TWS by Ptron beats all other brands which are available under 5000. Really loved the sound quality. The best part is that I can comfortably use them while running. Generally I used to face this problem while running that TWS slips from my ears and fall down. But these fits in my ears so perfectly that I literally don't have to worry about them.It won't be an injustice with all the other brands if I call these best under a budget of 5000.

  Sound quality is wonderful and clear. Bass is much better than in some costly ear buds. Just don't use it with high bass in equalizer. In fact it works beautiful and clean without equalizer. You can surely feel the bass. It offered very very little latency while watching flipkart videos and playing games. However there was absolutely no latency while watching YouTube and Amazon prime videos. Touch control is very sensitive. It may take time to get acquainted with touch controls. However, at a price of 1299, these buds offer much much more than your expectations.

    Not Useful
  
","









  
  
    
  I didn‚Äôt like the product. But before writing further, I would like to emphasize that we should always keep the price in mind.The sound quality is average. No appreciable bass effect. The pairing between the two earbuds interrupts frequenly. The angulated design makes it difficult to use as it is touch operated. Initially it is difficult to operate due to angulated surface but with time you learn how to do it.Listening to music aur movies may even be possible But using it for calls which is my primary use, is more difficult. It suddenly loses all voice, does not connect and calls become difficult. Sometimes it remains connected but there no sound, neither in the earphone nor in the mobile. You need to switch it off and then again turn on to make it work again.So, I will not advise anyone for this purchase. Although, we should understand that if we want to be completely satisfied with earbuds in all aspects, we have to go for higher price range like 10000 and above like jabra, apple, Sony etc.

  This was my 1st try at an wireless music device and I regret buying it without consulting. The connectivity is an issue even when the device is within 1ft range. The sound quality also falters whenever the bass is higher or when the music is having some other depth.

  True to my heart the make quality and product material and the finish is like that of grade 1 brand.The case was similar to smart car key. So it will be cool to hold it in hand. And the way it opens is so great.Battery back up, Ear pods alone - approx 3-3.5 hrs music playtime,  Case - Can charge 2.5 times those pods.But I had only three things which could have been better,1. There could be some ear loop kind of design since it falls of from my ear, may be this was my first experience with ear buds/pods I would have faced this. When people are okay using this kind of model already they can go for this.2. The blue light will be blinking for every 2-3 seconds when its in use. When I'm using this in night, the room used to glow blue and off. üò≥But not visible in day time.3. Since, this has entirely touch gestures, the volume adjustment gesture is to frequently tap right/left buds with even interval of time to increase/decrease resp. I faced some trouble in adjusting this way.Other than these 3 things, this product is really good.

  I had ordered this with much hesitation as I was in the market looking for wireless earphones with ear loops. Although this fits quite fine and is unlikely to fall off, there is another major problem I had with it - it simply blocks off your entire ear. It can be disconcerting if you aren't used to it. I like to listen to music while being aware a little bit of my surroundings.....I have a soundpeats bluetooth wired earbuds with ear loops that are brilliant - in the sense that the music quality was superb and you also had a bit of ear ventilation. I will thus be looking for only those buds that allow wireless connectivity but at the same time, make you feel comfortable and situationally aware without the sense of carrying something bulky inside my ear.

My inbox nokia earphone (included with basic Nokia phones) are much better.Went bad in just 6 days. I barely used it for 3-4 hours in total and it started giving a buzzing sound like a 50 Rs earphone. The battery percentage also is not reliable. It drops from 80% to 40% in 10 minutes. The case loses charge on its own and even if you don't use it, it loses charge in a couple of days. I have asked for a replacement and am hoping it holds on better.

  Faulty piece received. Left earbud was low in sound. Drivers should've been better than 6mm for such a latest device compared to their cheapest Lite model of 10mm drivers. Mids and highs should've been better compared to the lows. Waiting for a replacement and will update the review based on the new device.Edit 1: replacement received the very next day after the request. Since both earbuds are working loud and clear, I'm quite satisfied now but still feel that drivers could've been better and typeC charging instead of micro usb. Bass is quite good but mids and highs could've been better. Call clarity is okish. Missing the word 'HD' which is displayed on my phone screen on bluetooth. Don't really know if it's not HD voice on bluetooth or not available on bluetooth calls. All in all, satisfied but still doubt on longitivity and durability since it's plastic. Fits good in ear but loosens gradually from the ear which needs a little push in intervals. (I always have this issue of falling earbuds due to small and sensitive ear hole even though the ear size is little above average.) Noise cancelling is missing. All in all, pretty satisfied for the price point.

  I am using these buds from several days.these are amazing in use.The display of the case shows charge and this use to charge buds 3-4 times.Case is magnetic, very light and small in size.Just taking both the buds out from the case will pair themselves without doing anything. The bids are touched to use.After pairing amongst them, switching on the bluetooth of the phone will pair it automatically.Single bud can be used i.e. just take out any of the bud and switch on the bluetooth of your phone.Coming to sound quality, best woth high sound with very good bass.Bluetooth connectivity is good. there is no disturbance or disconnection.

  I use it on Apple products and the connection is terrible. If you're looking to use these for Apple products, don't buy, the connection is very patchy, keeps interrupting, the sound is fantastic though. Also, the touch is annoyingly sensitive! Please wait for other's reviews before you purchase this.

  Pros:Sound quality - It is pretty damn good. It is correctly named the Bassbuds because the bass is truly something nice here. I was pleasantly surprised with it. The highs are a bit on the muted aise though. The sound isn't as fuller as I had hoped it to be. But at least the bass is nice!Value for money: These truly are value for money.Battery backup: Fhe battery backup is decent. But rather low of you listen at full volume and songs with high amount of bass.Cons:Build quality: The build quality is the worst thing about this. It truly shows that it is budget oriented. The plastic used is pretty bad. Both in headphones and the base unit. Sometimes it feels like you will break it just opening up the base unit. The headsets also feel very flimsy. Feels like the buttons will break pretty soon.My unit in particular feels a bit defective, the headsets are rather loose in the base unit, and just closing the base unit's door sometimes ends up moving the headset in it and it stops charging and the hesdphone turns on thinking it has been removed from the base unit

  Good battery, nice case and a decent pair of buds for listening. That's about it..there are too many other annoyances to really enjoy them. First: The touch sensitive controls - if you need to adjust the earphones ( and you will need to, they keep slipping off) you will end up muting or starting the Google assistant and then you have to fiddle some more to go back to listening as before. I wish o could just turn off the touch controls. Second, the mic is terrible...really really bad. While I wasnt expecting fab HD mic, a properly functional one would have been great. I won't recommend this pair.

  I bought this product few days back. On the first day it was working fine seamlessly. I was happy with that but when I started to use on the second day , the distortion in the sound came into the picture. it tried reconnecting it with the phone and also before reconnecting I restarted the ear buds. But still the issue existed. I would recommend to go with the other product rather than this. If you budget is little tight you can go with this. The case is good and design is also good. Its light in weight. The ear starts hurting it if you use for a longer period, but again it depends on person to person based on the Ear structure.

  Noise cancellation works when you stuff the earpod so deep into your ear, even air can't pass. I use these when I walk and play a bit of music and even brisk walking causes the earpods to slip loose. Quite annoying I must add. Not suitable if you plan on doing phone calls while keeping the earpods on. It channels every little noise across. Terrible experience for the person on the other end. Even though I specifically choose the phone's internal mic for phone calls, the earpods somehow keep finding it's way into connecting with my phone. So you must turn off the Bluetooth if you have the device within 100 meters.Also, I have not used any other earpods so this is solely based on my experience of using this particular device.All said and done, I have learnt to live with the limitations it came with.

  I have been using this since more than a month. Was quite unsure before the purchase because it was a new launch and not much reviews were there. I wanted a low budget buds with good quality and since this is my first earbud purchase I can tell you the pros and cons from the perspective of a new user. Those who have expensive ones already can spot alot of differences but for the price you pay, this is some genuinely good device. Here are some pros and cons.Pros-1) Sound quality is really good if you mostly use it for watching videos and general stuff.2) I tried recording few videos with these connected and the quality was really good.3) Design is sleek and pretty.4) Buds are very comfortable in ears, won't hurt.5) Touch sensor is so good and fast, though I hardly use it.6) I tried playing Call of duty on phone and it was a good experience. Kind of little slow but if you realize the fact that thiese buds are cheap af you won't mind lol.7) Battery life is great. I don't stick with buds all the time so it's all good.Cons-1) Not for bass lovers. But that won't be a problem if yoy don't listen to song in full volume, I personally don't do that.2) Connection is slow sometimes. It is bit irritating when I get a call and try to connect this with Bluetooth but that doesn't happen always so its fine according to the price You're paying.Overall, the product is really good considering the fact that these are great at price point and design is not cheap at all which was my one of the most important concern of mine. If You're confused to buy this or not, go ahead with it without any second thought. :)

  The product stopped working in 2 weeks. I have been trying to reach Ptron customer care for more than 2 weeks now and there is no response to my emails and calls. Pathetic customer support. I'm still waiting to see if anybody responds before I initiate action through consumer affairs.Update- I received one response to my multiple emails after I threatened to initiate action through consumer affairs. Email simply asked me to send the product by courier to one Hyderabad address. Nobody answers the customer care Phone number. I did not bother to courier the product because knowing these guys, I'm sure I need to forget about the courier after sending.

  When it comes to earphones like this, wearing comfort can play a big role. I tend to find many earphones uncomfortable to wear, but this pTron was comfortable. I believe its lightweight design helps here.When it comes to audio quality, I'd give it a 'meh' rating. It's fine; it's not amazing, and it's not bad.Touch controls are borderline broken, however. They work maybe 20 to 30% of the times. You would be better off simply controlling your audio (adjust volume, skipping tracks, etc) from your phone than fiddle with the headphones and hope that it works.Bottom line: get this if lightweight and wearing comfort is very important to you and nothing else is as important.

  Received the ""PTron Bass buds Urban"" today itself. The charging case is made out of cheap quality plastic, and is coated with textured rubber, to give it a decent look.Noise cancelation feature seems to be a joke.When the volume is increased above 70% the sound seems to screech. Bass is definitely not up to the mark.Can't comment on the battery life as of now. I still have to test that. The product comes with a micro USB charging port, and not a type C port, which is another let down.As per my personal evaluation and opinion, the product is not worth more than 1000 bucks. Similar products are available for INR 999/- on Amazon.I wouldn't recommend this product to others.In all good probability, I will be returning this product.

  It fits my ear almost perfectly. Love the look and feel.Sound quality is pretty good. While listening to rock or heavy bass music it doesn't hurt my ears. Both bass and treble are well balanced.I use these mostly for calls and i didn't find any flaws till now. Sometimes i feel a little delay in response time in picking up/end calls.After wearing these, environment sound is almost un-heard even while ear buds are in Off state. I have to remove it from my ears to listen to the voices around me. So while walking, i use single bud for environmental awareness.Both buds and case are made of hard plastic and case has a leather finish. Case itself in closed state shows the battery indicator which is a good thing.

    A good earphone but with some issues, read this to find out more

  I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!

Detects and connects easily.Battery life is good. Stayed around 10-11 hrs.As i received this yesterday evening. Have been playing since then. So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.

    Extremely good BT earphones!! Loud and Super BASS.

  Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

  he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

  This is my first time using a boat earphone, I was using a wired earphone with the company or brand I don't know, I've got it as a gift from my relatives abroad, but the bass compared to that earphone, this doesn't have much bass, I don't know everyone keeps boasting this earphone is specifically made for bass, I had to go to the Equalizer and tweak the bass, even though it doesn't come closer to my other earphone, the highs are high lows are low, and if I tweak more I can feel the stress on the little speakers, I had a concert like experience with my other earphone but this one is average, and should be priced around 800 -900, this is overpriced and overrated.Aside from the bass it's all good so far, bluetooth connectivity is good, range is good, call quality is good, lag latency is low, battery backup is good.And the audio codec is SBC, AAC is supported but every time I set it to AAC it resets back to SBC, based on my research you'll need aptx hd to change the codecs. Which this earphone doesn't have.**UPDATE**I CAN PLAY AAC NOW, IT'S MY BAD, AFTER UPDATING MY PHONES FIRMWARES I'M ABLE TO PLAY AAC CODEC ON MY ROCKERZ 255 PROAND DO NOTE THAT THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME, SUCH IMPROVEMENT..GO FOR IT! I TAKE BACK ALL I SAID BEFORE.P.S ** YOUR PHONE MUST SUPPORT AAC CODEC BLUETOOTH V.5 WOULD BE BETTER, OTHERWISE THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWFUL I GOT IT WORKING ON MY PHONE AFTER AN UPDATE**

  It has fast charging and dual connectivity but i have noticed some issues. While using it, i can hear some noise through the headset and when i stop playing music or videos after 25 sec a small tik sound comes and the noise stops. If it is just connected and not playing anything, no noise can  be heard.Another thing is that, it doesn't show battery charge correctly. Sometimes it shows sudden drop in charge and the next second it shows full charge without recharging.If anyone has the same issues kindly  comment your experience. This is my second headset after replacement.Both have the same issue.While using it, i can hear some noise  through the headset, just like the noice that is heared while tuning a radio and when i stop playing music or videos after 25 sec a small tik sound comes and the noise stops.

  The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%.

  I am pleased to write a review and i will talk both about pros and cons:Pros:1. Good Bass2. Sturdy3. Great look4. Good noise cancellationCons:1. Forget buying this if you are planning to use it for gaming like battle royale games, There is an issue with the latency or bluetooth lag, You will hear the noise 3 seconds after you fire the gun.2. Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.UPDATE: AS OF TODAY, JAN 15TH 2020 - One of the sides stopped working within 6 months. However, I claimed the warranty and got a replacement in 15 days. No hassle apart from the duration to get a replacement.

  Close your eyes and just go for it. It is amazing at its price. I have got it at a festival sale which costs me 999 rupees. There is everything perfect in these bluetooth earphones. The bass is amazing even more than sony and jbl bt earphones. The sound is crystal clear. Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones. And at last these earphones are stereo supported so you can enjoy 360 songs and also play pubg with these bluetooth earphones. Really i love boat.

  There's no clarity in sound it produces only bass that to it is not pure deep bass. It's sounds very local the mids n highs are the worst. One may go for it by looking at the price but trust me Bass in not the only thing to be considered the sound quality is also very important. Even the bass is not all pure it just sucks when u hear it for more than 1 hrs. I have returned the product. Please don't buy this product there's no Sound Quality.

  I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

    Great earphones fir bass, MIC has no noise cancellation

  Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

  So this is my take on the boAt Rockerz 255 Sports Bluetooth after one month of usage and hope this satisfies most of the queries here.Pros:------1. Pretty Quick Connectivity. It hardly took me less than a minute to get started with it.2. The sound quality is quite good. While driving on high altitude windy areas, the sound clarity is still clear and that makes me give it a thumbs up.3. The battery life lasts for almost 3 days and thats quite reasonable for meCons:-------1. Though there aren't many cons but yes the noise cancellation is quite less when compared to many other earphones2. Quality checks need to be taken care of since we had to get one of our earphones exchanged due to connectivity issueOverall it is a great value for money for earphones. Do pick it up,

  I have been using this product for more then 6 months.At the time of perchesing this earphone, i was really confuse between Realme or Boat Rockers pro.but after boot rockers pro, I am very happy with my decision.Very Good product by boat.I thought that 6hrs battery backup will be less for me but after usning i have seen that it gives more 8 hrs and it only takes 20 min max to get full charge.6 hr is for if you have been playing non-stop music for 6hrs.I put on charging only for 20-25 min in morning and use it full day without turnning off for a single minute.To be true the performance was amazing..Here is some key information about the product: 1.It can connect with 2 device at same time.I connect with my phone and laptop which is very benifitial for me, I attain meeting and online classes on laptop and in between any phone call comes on my mobile it automatical switches towords call and after the call back to my lappy. when i play video on both phone or laptop it automatical switch towords whereever video is playing. 2.support fast charging(only in the ""PRO"" modle). 3.Audio quality is best. 4. light weight.

  I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

  Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

  Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

Another little annoying thing apart from connecting with Windows Laptop is the crackling sound which I can hear sometime for no reason even in close proximity of the streaming device.

  I have earlier used two Boat earphones, and this was my third purchase.Packaging - great. It came in a box which includes extra eartips, manual, USB charger, earphones and a case.Sound quality - good at the price range. The bass is strong, good for edm.Bluetooth connectivity - good, both range wise and quick pairing. It has two device pairing. I earlier had connectivity issues between Lenovo devices and boat, none this time.Noise cancellation - decent.Fit - the earbuds aren't the most comfortable but shouldn't be any pain with moderate use. Also, it is unlikely to fall off with fast walk or jogging. However, the neckabamd seems flimsy.What I didn't like - I have never been a fan of neckband style earphones. And these looked ill fitted. The neckband and the wires are bigger than required.I didn't use it for the ill fitting so would have to cut the review short.

  First of all. It is very comfortable. Doesn't fall from ear no matter how hard you shake head or dance.The sound is loud enough. Noise cancellation is awesome. Bass is good but sound signature is not so deep and quality sound you might expect. Treble is okay. Build quality seems very good it will last long. The magnetic strength is good and holds it secure.(not very good though)The bluetooth range is very good. Keeping it in the centre of my house(1800sq.ft) I can roam in the house freely without disconntions. And the bluetooth 5.0 offers dual pairing.It's micro usb, would have been game changer in this price if it was usb type C.Can't comment on battery life as it's my first day. And the fast charging is seens such a good feature.Thinking to test the IP ratingü§£Bought yellow color but will go for the blue one.

  The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

  I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

  I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

  Overall, a steal at this price range. It has that thumping bass factor which is missing these days in most of the midrange earphones. I have used both Realme wireless buds as well as this Boat Rockers 255 pro. Here is the comparison:Pros:1- For a bass lover like me, this earphone is better than the Realme buds. It has a nice thump feel.2- Fast charging. Gets fully charged in less than one hour.3- Earpieces are magnetic attached to each other. This gives a good grip around the neck.4- Wire is dust and sweat proof.5- Battery can last upto 10 hrs if used only for calls.Cons:1- On continuous music usage, battery lasted for around 6-7 hrs.2- Bluetooth auto-disconnect feature not present when the buds are stick together. This does impact the battery performance. Realme takes the advantage here.3- No USB-C support. No big deal.

Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose.

  The product is very thoughtful. What I would have liked though is a place to hand the cable and the ear extensions since when I place them in the wireless charging pack I need to remove them and the Rubber holder does not have any place for this.Would have liked some design idea as you put for the iwatch placeholder.

  Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bassJust at the low volume its a bit too soft need to keep the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel. Distance from the phone pretty much 10 or 15 meter later it get a bit faded. Looks too good permium quality the led lights on the CTC ( capacitive touch control ) . The fit is too good if any problems you feel its a bit loose change the ear tips. It fits really well in helmets but an advice do not use both together while riding a bike you literally can't hear much . The CTC button is too sensitive but need to get used to it.The colour variant is too catchy really nice. I was expecting a big charging case but when I saw it was so small like literally fits ino your palm.Iys has magenetic charging so your airdope dont fall off and the lid is magnetic so it wont open unecssarily. Its has a C type charging port thats one great thing done by boAt since most of the phones have C type charging port  you wont have to search for a charger. I just got it today still need to play around with it will update in a while . Overall great product ,only the volume at the low which does'nt sound great needs a bit fix but thumbs up great product must buy.And great delivery and packaging by Amazon.

    Best buds in the budget with Type C
  
","









  
  
    
  I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.3. Select Feat. JBL E1+4. Open Preset options5. Select Blues and Voila!! üéØFor other phones -I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! üôÇHappy Listening! üé∂

  Got these in the Amazon Prime Sale. Was not sure what to expect as I have been on the lookout for  tws for quite sometime. Wanted to buy a Made In India product but I guess that wish cannot be fulfilled at this moment as these are also sourced from  PRC.  As for the overall build quality they are good and offer iPx7 water resistance. Needed something for my running needs as I sweat a loot and all my earbuds died out because of the sweat. Since these were delivered yesterday I used them today in my morning run. The fit is extremely good and satisfy all my needs. Had worn them for close to 1 hour 15 minutes and not even once did they get loose. The fit was perfectly fine. As for the battery in 1 hour the battery charge came to 80% from 100 with a  volume of around 65 to 75 % on my One Plus. You need to use a slightly higher volume to enjoy them. Not that the volume is low but then I had to use it at that percent. So a full charge would go for 4.5 to 5 hours at the max with continuous listening but then who listens music for that long a time. Also the sound quality is more towards the bass side. With higher volume the bass becomes too high and as such I did not enjoy it.  Boat should have balanced that out. As for the battery bank it is huge and the airdopes get's charged extremely fast. The airdopes were charged from 70% to 100% in less than 15 minutes. Overall happy with them just wish the bass was a bit more controlled.#### Update 11th Aug:Have been using them regularly since they were delivered i.e the 8th. The battery percentage on the storage has reduced to 75% after using it for almost 4 to 5 hours daily since then. The  earbuds are very secure in fit probably the best if you would like to use them during your workout. Though I would have to buy a new set for 2 phone connectivity during my drives as they do not support dual phone connectivity. Till now very satisfied with them. Also would like to add that the touch in there pods are very accurate.#######Update 14 Aug:1. Since 8th when I got the case to 100% charged I haven;t recharged them as yet and the battery is still holding to around 50% +2. Have been using them for 2 to 3 hours on daily basis3. The earlier review was on using the airdopes on amazon music. Since then I have used youtube and ganna to hear the songs and found that they are more balanced and loud when playing songs from ganna or youtube than from amazon music. I use my one plus at around 50 to 55% when listening songs on Ganna and youtube. not sure if this is just in my mind.4. Another thing that I have observed is that one in while say 2 to 3 times a day the left airdopes would disconnect for an instance and then connect back immediately. I have been observing this almost on a daily basis. Hope these last for some time and hope that the left ones do not give away.5. I increased the volume to 100% on my phone to check on the battery and the battery on the airdopes went to 70% in approx a hour however with 65% to 75% of the volume it had gone down to 80% from 100% in an hour.6. Another plus point of the big  battery storage case is that it charges the airdopes super fast.########### Update - 22 Aug 2020 after 2 weeks of usageAfter two weeks of usage below are the updates:Pros:1.  Battery backup in case is very good. With usage of aprox. 1 to 2 hours every day the case is still holding approx 40% of charge even after 2 weeks. Very good option for people who travel for say 2 to 3 hours in a day in public transport.2. The earbuds can easily continuously work for 4.5  hours at a stretch without requiring a recharge3. The earbuds charge at a very fast rate because of a high battery capacity of the case4. Earbuds are good to listen to the songs and who ever is a fan of bass can easily go for these.5. The Build quality of the case and ear buds are descent.6.  At least I find the fit of the earbuds very comfortable and do not have issue wearing them. I use for my runs which last for approx 1 hour and never had any issues. This is a personal preference.7. There is no noise cancellation but the fit of the earbuds is such that it automatically stops all the external noise.Cons:1. I happen to loose  Bluetooth connection once in a while while using them. This is more for the left earbud than the right side.2. These are not good for phone calls. The call quality is not good and the  person on the other side faces issues listening to me.3. Since I use these on multiple devices. I have to manually make it connect when I change the device even if the Bluetooth is active on one single device.I have not been hearing any static noise as few have been complaining. Also I need to check how much time it takes to charge the case.

  The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive. Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears.

  I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441.  Also, the sound quality is best. But this noise has made me dislike the product. Sorry. Returning it.

  Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.Pros:1. Great Sound Quality2. Great Bass3. Great Battery Life4. Fast ChargingCons:1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.

  From the first look, they really looked very nice. I bought the red colour, and the red colour pops-up really nice.They Charging Case is also very nice looking.I wore them for a few minutes, and my ears started hurting.The fitting is going to be different for each user, depending on the size of their years and their comfort.Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass.For people who would like to use it for official or personal calls, will feel that you will Sound robotic to the other person.There is also a delay in voice-over, which I think it‚Äôs not that bad.The noise cancellation is not there at all.These are much better than a few of similar products available in the market. However, it will be to each user to choose these based on their comfort level as well as their pocket.

    Really Good product
  
","









  
  
    
  * It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.* Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive* The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.* I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.* While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.**** Batteryüîã review (after 2 weeks)Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6¬Ω hrs.Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT.

    Must buy if you are a basshead
  
","









  
  
    
  If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month,  3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.Battery Life: 4/5Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids  are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :)

  The earphones are good. Only problems are that it pains after one hour of use. Can't hear outside noise. Noise cancellation is not good. Capacitive button is cuts call and plays and pauses music while handling. Buttons are much better. Too much disco lights.Rest everything is good.

  The good:+ Connection is alright+ Build quality+ Touch controls+ Sound quality is also not bad+ Battery life+ Battery bank feature and type c charging are very welcomeThe bad:- THERE IS A CONSTANT STATIC IN THE LEFT EARBUD, its not noticeable when anything is playing but as soon as you pause audio its right there. Tolerable, but annoying.- Too big for small ear- Design makes it so the wings can irritate the inside of your ears if you're moving around.- Way too much bass, balanced sound is out of the window.

    Customer service of BoAt sucks. I'm highly frustrated now.
  
","









  
  
    
  I'm writing this one, as a follow up to my previous review/feedback.After around 2-3 months of following up with the boat customer service and after the complaint with the National Consumer forum I received the replacement for my original faulty product.Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.üò† Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat. This time it took at least 3 weeks of time(which is okay with me as compared to the delay experience i had earlier) to get this faulty product replaced.Finally, I was happy with this 2nd time replaced product, everything in this one seemed perfect. But it has been just 15 days since I received the airdopes and now I find that the right ones battery gets exhausted within 15-20 mins after a full charge whereas the left one with the same amount of charge can run for more than an hour.I don't know what's wrong with this product or what's wrong with the Boat guys. This is literally frustrating for any customer. After replacing 2 times and waiting to receive a good product for more than 4 months of purchasing it still I'm hankering for it.All I wanted is to let you all know my experience with these airdopes. Now i literally realize that I wouldn't have purchased this product at all. I should have gone for some wired earphones which is far better than these or would have gone for some other company. I'm being cheated by Boat again and again.Customer service sucks... Neither they test a faulty product properly nor they test the one sending as a replacement. Then my question is why are they sitting over there?? Why they take so much of time to get us the replacement???

  Please avoid buying this as there is a constant hissing sound in the left airdope. Though it worked perfectly for the initial 2-3 days, the sound once developed is only becoming worse every passing day. Also, many other buyers too have pointed out the same issue, so I guess its a manufacturing fault.

  So finally after returning 4 bluetooth earphones  üòú(I. E. Wings earbuds, Crossbeats Wave, realme earphones (which were actually fake from seller) and Sony xb55ap) I landed on to this amazing sound machine from Boat after checking reviews on many sites and YouTube. I am a audiophile and I needed the best earbuds/earphones at a budget of 3k atmost. After listening to music and checking call voice quality, here is my review :Pros :1. I was impressed with the BASS and clear sound quality after checking so many earphones and buds and you will never regret buying with these buds.2. The fit is perfect as they don't even feel like falling off.3. Bluetooth connectivity is very smooth and both buds are connected separately just after opening the case every time. (if any of the buds does not get connected automatically then don't worry at all,just press it for 3 seconds and it will be paired to the other bud.4. Battery life is good as I used it for 2+ hours and they were on 60% till then.5. They don't look big after wearing them like other earbuds.Cons :1. Case's build quality is ok but not sturdy.2. No noise cancellation at all, this should be taken into consideration by Boat.That's all from my end guyzzz!!!I am writing this review just to help those people who wants to enjoy their music with latest & affordable tech and great sound quality.

    Good for a budget earphone
  
","









  
  
    
  Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go. Magnetic box is efficient for securing the earbuds. LED indicator is functioning properly.Cons: Brace yourself-Bluetooth connectivity lost arbitrarily in between music. Call quality is not upto the mark- sound is poor despite adjusting call volume, initial and end parts of a call are lost with almost no noise cancellation. No gesture or facility for volume control. With no buttons and only touch maneouvred gestures it is very difficult to adapt to listening music or calling for long hours. Gesture are congested and not user-friendly.Overall I would like to rate this a 3/5 for a budget bluetooth earphone.

Overall sound quality isn't up to the mark as expected from boat. Only buy if you don't use earphones that often and only want to try truly wireless earphones.

  Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look. Initially I was too confused in chosing earbud. From xiomi to  crossbeats to sony, I planned for everything. Unfortunately all had negative n positive reviews. So went for a fresh product and writing the review after 1 hr of use.Sound n music quality is good. Built is premium. 2600 mah case, type C charging is best. Ipx7 is added in pro.I bought it for calling purpose and I tested indoor n no one could differentiate that I was calling from earbud. So thumbs up.Hopefully in long run the review holds true!

  Static hiss in the left earpiece when connected to device but no music is being played. Must be some manufacturing defect in the batch because the same problem arose in the replaced product. Other than for  this reason its a great product, good looks ,comfortable and nice sound.Have been using boat products for a while now so a little disappointed with this product.*many wont even mind the hiss,but its annoying once you notice it.** 5 stars for Amazon for quick delivery ,replacement and customer service.

  This is a very nice product in the range of 2000 rupees. It has good built quality . The connectivity is very fast and airdopes have a very nice backup and fast charging.Coming on sound quality, the sound is pretty balanced. It  has awesome base due to the 6mm drivers. Many eardopes also have 10mm drivers but the problem in them is that you will only hear the base and nothing else. But in these eardopes the instruments and vocals are pretty clear besides the boom base!! They provide a overall balance. Sometimes you may feel overbased but 95‚ÑÖ times the sound is balanced.The fitting is really very nice and they do not fall out of ears at all. It has very nice grip. Good for sports also.

I have given it 4 stars for less Bass quality.I used it today when it was raining and it is still working. I have a Bose soundsport.

  I would keep it short and pointed out:1. Connectivity is pretty nice - connects instantly on lid open.2. Seamless stereo/mono switch - works fantastic every time. No issues faced3. Build is pretty good - for the price, the build quality is really good. The LED is fantastic i must say4. Touch - the touch is just, well, too good. It takes up at any point, the slightest of touches and that MIGHT be irritating at times5. Sound - in one word, GOOD! Actually good is being really vague. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming. Bassheads will not be really sad with this. Instrument separation is good even though the mids are a little muffled. Pure vocal artists will lose the edge there. The punch will be really high in songs like Get Lucky, Madness etc. So yes, for this price point, the sound is good.6. Fit - perfect fit, doesn‚Äôt fall off. But sadly, very subjective, hurts my ears after 45 minutes or so. If your ears don‚Äôt hurt, go nuts doing any exercise you want.7. Passive noise cancellation - brilliant but with an underside of not hearing ANYTHING AT ALL from outside. So keep that in mind and do the needful when out wearing them.I cannot comment on the battery or long term issues. I have used it for my runs and casual listening. For the price, this is really a decent bud pair!!

  When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2999 and within days - it was priced at 2499.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. This was my first ever purchase with boAt I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 1499.

  COMFORT:I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.NOISE CANCELLATION:Don't have to worry about it wearing off easily üëçüèª. Noise cancellation is also great it blocks all the noise around you (fan, tv noises, etc...).BATTERY BACKUP:Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 8-10 days.MIC:My only concern is the mic, while on phone some people, on the other hand, have complained about my voice (too low and breaking) but it just may be because of my low volume speak, so anyone who have low pitch speaks you would have to speak a little louder.CAPACITIVE BUTTON:The touch buttons are too sensitive, so during a workout the song stop sometimes because of my shoulder or my shirt. Also during a call, if  I have to remove the ""AirDopes"" my hand would accidentally touch the capacitive button and the call gets disconnected (one solution to this is to first disconnect them from the phone first, then remove them).SOUND QUALITY:I have no complaints about the sound quality. The bass is PERFECT not too much (as seen earlier on older boat products, they fix it I guess).  The high and low are also clear.

  These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:1: Budget2: decent sound3: Good Bass4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 üåü rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.For me this was a major low  unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars.

  2 months of usage and previous unit replaced so updating the review.. the bluetooth issue is resolved in replaced piece, so overall it's a good product with balanced sound at good price if purchased under 2400*****Roughly 1 day of usage, bluetooth disconnecting soon as soon as u get little away from device.. or even when you use one earbud and keep other away with phone with you, it will cut u out.. that itself was worrysome but now I connected with my android set top box for TV viewing and it's not connecting constantly. Though TV is right in front of me 3m away. Even Boat rocker headphone I use otherwise works better than this.These things are not being told or checked in youtube reviews availble strangely, either they are paid reviews or they don't check thoroughly.Ear grip is good, sound is reasonable but when I was watching BBT on prime video, sound was relatively low. So overall it seems a good buy if u just want to use it in both ear with phone in pocket all the time or for some gaming. Call was disrupted too couple of times..Probably will return this unless Boat provides a solution to bluetooth issue.

Was very happy on the initial use of work call and music during work. Trouble started on day 2, when I used it for workout. Even a slight touch on the left pod starts iTunes. This was a big annoyance as I was listening to something off iTunes. Then tried connecting to my Android, but it wasn't pairing. On day 3, when I opened the case, the left pod wasnt charged and ran out of battery again soon. Returned it to get another box, which had left pod charging issues repeatedly. Ended up returning that too.

    Awesome earbuds

  Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks.

  I got it delivered yesterday.  Everything is good. But my left ear bud is having a technical glitch type sound while playing any music and it is very disturbing to the ears. But I have full faith on Amazon. I have requested for a replacement.  I have full faith that in my next delivery the problem will be fixed.It was a technical problem. Just a faulty piece maybe. Other than that the product is really good. Took just an hour to full charge when taken out from the box first.

  Well for the first time I'm using the term ''disappointed'' for boAt but this time you people have failed to live upto the expectations.I had purchased boAt 441 on 15 June, 2020 which got delivered on 18 June,2020. My overall experience was okayish as the bass quality and the voice quality was pretty decent until today (28 June,2020).My audio device is not working as the person on the other side can not hear a word i say. The whole purpose of buying this headphone is defeated. Considering the work from home scenario I had purchased it to make myself comfortable while attending the 'n' number of calls I get; however, the comfort was short-lived. I hope I get a better replacement for this faulty device.

  Ordered it during sale, received it quickly enough. Pairing was easy, size of the charging case is nice and small. The magnets are strong to hold the buds in its place within case. Added bonus that charging case comes with usb C charging. Voice is decently clear for calls.Here is the problem, the left earbud has low hum/ringing noise. Like tr tr tr tr tr ..... when music is not playing.I figured it needed a factory reset, tried it. No change.Figured it could be external interference, tried it in open place and no change. It almost like they got quality control issue.Did a return and replace and new item is also same. I‚Äôm not sure if this is specific to black model or all models. I‚Äôll be returning this and get something else.

  Pros:1) Good sound quality2) Decent call quality (as good as can be expected from an ear-pod). Not perfect though so if your requirement is more for calls then consider other options. If requirement is more for songs/movies and few calls then you can go for it.3) Nice charging case4) Durable : My kid dropped it in a glass of water. I immediately took it out and to my surprise it didn't stop workingCons:1) If not put properly, your ear will start aching after few minutes2) Touch button for calling/disconnect so if you adjust the ear pod in the middle of a call, more often than not it will disconnect the call3) There is a slight lag in reaction time which is not a deal breaker as you get used to it.

    Left earbud noise
  
","









  
  
    
  Bought the boat blue airdopes. Used it for 2days and it was working fine. But on the third day the connectivity started getting distorted even in the next room even with bending and moving. That was very disappointing. Also there was a constant tr tr tr.. noise in the left ear bud which is very low but it is noticeable. This noise only comes when the music is on. When the media stops playing the noise also stops. The voice calling is extremely poor. The person on the line will get a lot of background noise and the voice gets cracked, it was a very bad experience. So it is only suitable for listening to media. Ordered replacement. Hope the problem does not persist in the replaced model too.UPDATE : Got the replacement. The left bud noise is still there. It is lower than the previous pair. It seems like the problem persists in all products of this model. Think just have to ignore the noise.

  I am really impressed by boat's sound quality. Here is my observation about the product that includes its pros and cons:1. The most impressive fact is that the case unit is very compact and easy to carry.2. The bass quality is amazing for such small size. 10/10 for its bass.3. Treble could have been better, but it really depends on quality of mp3 song.4. Touch control is good but not great, it is an amazing feature but there is a finite lag in response.5. I wish that battery back up was more as I hate charging gadgets frequently. Battery back up is only average and there is definitely a lot of scope for improvement.6. This product is definitely better than its competitors in the market and at such reasonable price its definitely a ""go-go!!""7. The ear flag which is particularly provided in these ear buds only helps the buds to stay stable in the ear and they won't fall off while walking, exercising and jogging.8. A built in mic helps to answer calls.9. The ear buds can work as single piece/mono mode or together/stereo mode.

  This is a revised rating of the product and review of my experience after 8 months of use these air dopes.Firstly about my experience with the Brand, I had first purchased boAt BassHeads 225 In-Ear Super Extra Bass Headphones on 2017, and was impressed with the quality and sturdiness of the product as they were working till Dec 2019.Based on that I bought boAt BassHeads 900 On-Ear Wired Headphone in Dec 2018, these only lasted till March 2020, with internal wiring issues and the ear-pads crumbling.Now Coming to these AirDopes, purchased in Dec 2019, I went thought the reviews and ignored the -ve ones as I was still impressed by the sound quality & product stability at the price till then.I started facing issues initially when the airdopes would drop off while on the treadmill, I thought I was expecting too much.Next issue started in a couple of months when I would go for walk with these and I would find that with the walking movement the sound would get keep breaking in the same rhythm.So no use of these wireless headphones on outdoors or exercising.Now since July during calls the party on other side cannot hear anything if I use airdopes.Every succeeding experience with boAt products has been worse than previous one. This is my last boAt purchaseWorst part is that this is still under 1 yr warranty. I am trying to contact warranty support and their numbers are not connecting and their website for does'nt work ""Cannot contact reCAPTCHA. Check your connection and try again.""

  Boat did not live upto the expectations i had for it after their boat stone 200 speaker :(I likee the design of the case and earbuds. They're comfortable, but thats all.The sound quality isn't quite the ""flagship killer"" quality i was expecting, and the on-earpiece-buttons aren't very user friendly either.

  It's not at all good experience because thses earphones have average sound quality and the problem with my earphones is bluetooth connectivity is the worst. Many a times bluetooth is disconnected for on of the earphones and sometimes for both.Also when I m using these earphones for calling.. it's mic is useless.. u have to literally shout on the road or hold on earphone near the mouth.. I want the solution for this.And the worst part is I can't claim for anything as sometimes connectivity is proper.. so I won't be able to prove this infront of them always..

  The product was good and comfortable.  The only issue i faced was about battery backup . You will be able to use for about 2 and half an hours and also the product is little heavier for me but we will be used to it within a week . So my opinion is that if u r looking for low budget wireless earphones  go for it but and also remember that battery backup is much lower than what it is mentioned .

  cons: Well it's decent for just use as Bluetooth headset, bass is there hardcore however the beats are not clear even if you listen to original track also.

The new product was good but started giving problems after a day or two. Voice was distorted, no noise cancellation.If you have freedom to speak loudly go for the product. It is good when coming to sound. You can use for music but couples with low sound talking the communication will be worse than anything.

  I have been using boat airpods 201 for almost 1 month.. it has been a good experience...so i am sharing some points i observed:-*PRO'S1. Sound quality is really good2. Noise cancelation is good3. Bluetooth connectivity is good, get connected fast and the range of connection is good (somewhere 5m)?4. It fits great in my ear and doesn't slip..but it can vary from person to person ( it doesn't fit in my friend ears, and keeps on slipping).5. Battery life is ok ok of the airpods and of the power box it is good.6. It is Handy, can even be fitted in pocket. But can be lost easily if not handled carefully.*CONS1.it sometime* causes glitch while playing. So usually i connect it again.. and it is gone.2. Calling is impossible with these, the person on other side always complain about the voice ..as it have extra sensitive microphone ..it captures all sound in surrounding.*I bought this even after knowing that calling will be a problem as it was not so much important for me .. priories could be different of different people.# To mention :- i bought it for 1500/- on amazon sale on January.I hope this review will help you in taking your decision whether to buy or not.

  Earlier I gave 3 stars but now changing it to one... Charging case is not charging so as buds.. I mean what the hell? Sound flactuations was okay but product failing with charging? It doesnot gets charged.. Charging starts with 3rd point. Buds gets discharged in 10-15 mins.. When i put buds back in case, case charging drops to 1 point from 4 point instantly..its been only 4 months since i bought it. I really need this to be resolved

  Good price for the awesome mono earbud. Charges pretty fast, battery lasts a good time. Charging case just awesome. Good sound (is actually pretty loud).Bass is alright . Connects flawlessly. Voice calling is also alright. Have to speak a little louder. Product very compact and can fit into pocket very easily. Fits ear perfectly without falling problem.10/10 would recommend this product.

  It will work reasonably well as a Bluetooth headset for listening to music. But it is totally useless for making phone calls. The other party can barely hear you and having a conversation is impossible. If your intention is to buy a Bluetooth headset for making phone calls, then this product is not for you.

  Likes:1) Form factor2) Connectivity / BluetoothDislikes:1) Sound quality 6/102) Noise cancellation 7/103) Most irritating feature is that when you get a call, you get to hear the complete number which is calling you. A better experience would have been if the device temporarily downloaded the phone book to itself and could reproduce the name under which the number has been saved in the mobile phone.

","









  
  
    
  After 20 days of use, am writing this review. I was using samsung HM1100, it has excellent a sound clarity and connectivity range. But in ptron earbud, if you put your mobile in your pant pocket itself, there was a noise disturbance while speaking. Only if you have clear place its working properly. Always you have to use ptron earbud in front of connected device. Am using it with my samsung m30 mobile.

  Everything is good about this and I lived using this. A major drawback is that it's so small in size that more than using it I spent more time in searching for ear piece and lost the ear piece it within a month time now, the case is around though. I wish the charger case had come with a band so that I can hang it down from the wrist or handbag that they both stay together as a set. Bah! Im so upset now and looking at the empty case feels miserableüò≠

  The sound quality is great for music and videos but slightly low for calls. It works well enough for calls but is not loud enough so one strains to hear. There is no separate volume control on the device itself.Takes time to get a good fit in the ear but less chances of it falling down during normal walking and talking.One caution - you must turn it off before placing in the charging case, else the phone keeps connecting and disconnecting. That's why I reduced on star, my expectation was it would turn off automatically when placed in the case.I connected with Samsung note 10, Microsoft surface tablet and HP laptop. No problems at all.

  Excellent  packing. The card box itself gives all the details very nicely.  The manual is again very well scripted  and explains  the features  very well. Fast delivery.Booked on 29th October 2020 received the next day.Charging case is very good.  Cute with Matt finish.  Earbud is glossy and tiny hence little slippery. But then you  can use it with care. The bud fits very well into my ears. No issues. Sound quality is very  good. Connectivity  is again good. Range is about 18 ft. LED charging  light  is very clearly visible both on the earbud and the case. Since I don't  use it for making calls I have not tested it for the same. I am happy  with  the product.  The music play time is about  5 hours  on one charge.Friends at 599/- this is a really  good product.  My only  worry is what happens  if the charging  case goes out of order?Friends  just go for  it. I might  buy one more piece.

  Using it since nearly last 6 months now. Definitely cute and handy in terms of look and feel and do its basic job well at its price. Initially was working fine, however with time the challenge is the battery life. For me it has reduced drastically now. Also the charging case is malfunctioning. Though Bluetooth connectivity was never an issue but audio (mic) quality is poor while talking and the person on the other side can hardly listen after sometime. Though music / songs works pretty well.

  I have purchased this for office call and personal use, overall product is ok,All i have compare this based on my Boat Bluetooth headphoneOverall Points :1. Charging pod is made with average plastic look and feel.2. Charging pod led lights are very small and really confusing what exactly happening ( charging what Ear-bud or Charging Pod ) description given in manual is not clear so far3. Ear-bud is looks stylish, built quality is good, but very slippery, specially when removing from charging pod is not that easy, it's magnetic holding is good, so you can consider this.4. Battery worked good for 3 Hrs on Office call, it was still running after that, As this is new product so further not sure.Consider Major :1. Volume is very low, i connected with my Laptop and mobile, i have to move my sound bar up to 100% then it is ok to hear, but if you are walking on street or somewhere noisy place it is very difficult to hear, you have to concentrate on audio.2. Bass - forget it3. MVP button works perfect.4. Range is not so good, they said 10mtr. but it does not work like that, any obstacle between come voice is breakingOverall this product is for those who are looking for low price Bluetooth, don't like to hear high bass audio and don't like loud voice or music, then definitely go for it

  I am writing after using this for about 1 month. (brought it on 30 Jul)Excellent product, especially at Rs 700.  thus for it is best bluetooth (since last 5-6 years).Sound quality at both sides its excellent. i mostly use it for Calling purpose and it serves the purpose with aplomb.Battery is amazing. never could really measure as i get it for more than 3 days. hence i assume this not less than 6-7 Hrs. Charging Box is very good. it can charge twice without getting charged itself.Build quality is really good. i am planning for 1 more soon. just as a back up.Cautions : it being very small and delicate, i don't risk using it outside (as it may fall down). i use it only when  i am static (Office or Home) or while car driving. i avoid using this while walking, workout, biking etc...(for this have another one neck-round  type)Summary : worth every penny. Go for it blindly. you will not regret.

Once paired connects automatically to nearest paired device as you remove from charging box. Lights up as shown in photo once you return to box.

  I'm writing this reviwe after using it extensively. Sound quality is surprisingly good for budget price and has a lot more bass than the lightsky wireless bluetooth earphones. Call quality is clear with no issues listening and talking to people on the other line. Good battery life during high-volume music playback. Pairing is quick and phone recognises earphones right away once powered on. Audio does not intermittently cut out when phone is in pocket like other reviewers have experienced. Audibly informs you when powered on, power off, and low battery. Earphone does noise cancellation well if voulme is high enough and music has a lot of bass. Bluetooth connection stays solid and connected unless out of certain range. overall a perfect earphones for everyday use

  The earbuds are really nice. It has tws technology. It connects to my mobile phone automatically when I remove the earbuds from the box. It is so tiny that even I can keep it in my pocket and carry anywhere with ease. Sound quality and noice cancellation  are too good. The product really is much more worth than the price.

    Battery backup is not 20hrs as written...it is only 6 to 7 hrs
  
","









  
  
    
  Its battery life is same 6 to 7hrs as others give....but the only difference is that other Bluetooth battery low warning comes at 10 % battery left whereas in this Bluetooth this battery low warning comes at 50% .....which is really very annoying...& U must have to charge if its battery comes at 50% ....so it is useless...means if 50% charge is left then why r u giving warning...that simply means that only it is showing that 50% battery is left but in actual it is 10% left.

  Bought this Zebronics earbuds sometime back and to be honest, im completely satisfied with this.I have the white colored version, it looks simply classic and premium.  remember opening the Bluetooth menu for pairing Sound Bomb with my phone initially, now it gets connected before I even take it to my ears.Since Im a business professional, use these earbuds a lot for calls and music and quality is good. Calling is seamless, havn't faced any problem with the voice call feature and the mic quality is really good. I prefer this during conference calls while at work.Such a comfortable snug fit inside my ear, the touch panel is smooth and I really like the way it's charging case just slides into my pocket. It may sound silly, but I just keep clicking the charging case - open and close, that is a lowkey stress reliever.It has now joined me in the gym too, first I wasn't sure if it was sweat-proof but then got clarified it is splash & sweat proof.Now my workout isn't complete without Sound Bomb and a Bass rich playlist.I ought to mention the google assistant support, if you are away from your phone then its a great way to control.

  Bluetooth issue which I noticed: If you go few steps away from your phone lets say 10-15 feet then I noticed that the music will fast forward by itself. I tested in the whole house sometime it happens in short distance and sometime going into other room. If its a distance issue technically the bluetooth should disconnect or the sound should stop rather than fast forward.Battery issues in the headphone. battery Level dropped from 50 to 0 in 5 minutes.

It is more trustworthy than other Chinese companies like noise , boult etc and I've also checked those products but honestly i return oneplus bullets z 3 days ago and they cost me 2000 for them but sound was not satisfactory nd this one is a next level quality provided in a TWS in such a pocket affordable amount of money , dont think guyz just go for it without thinking.

    Zebronics sound bomb review
  
","









  
  
    
  Zebronics has done a great job.Bought this to gift someone.Now I'll mention some of the good and bad parts of this TWS:-GOOD( pros)-1. Approx 5 hours of battery life2. Type C charging support3. Clear sound quality (bass is nice)4. Call quality is average but not bad at this price pointBad( Cons)1. Case is magnetic but magnets are not powerful. One might drop the earbuds in case flips the case opened (which I think a biggest flaw of this. This is totally not acceptable. Zebronics should take care of such small factors which could make a huge difference)2. Sometimes while palying YouTube if you pause and after sometime one earbuds(specially left) gets disconnected. Not a big issue cause one can simple put them inside case or reconnect and boom it's back again.Rest all is just awesome.Thank you! üôè

  Perfect fit. Light weight. Long lasting battery with rechargeable case which allowed 2 recharges. Tap to pick call function not quite adequate. Good sound but with treble. Not for music. Unfortunately not good for phone calls either as voice is not picked up clearly and there is a lot of disturbance. Not worth buying. Waste of money.

Bit bulky in size(charging case).  earphone had fell off from my ear  while taking off the mask.  earphone are perfectly fit in ear  didn't come off while shaking head.*Battery Backup1. Earphone:- single earphone can  last over 6hrs(50% volume).  both earphone can last up to  3to4hrs of battery backup  according to the sound you are  listerning.  charging time 1hr(0to100)2. Charging case:- Full charge can last  up to 3to2 days of battery backup.  charging time 2hr(0to100)*Touch Controls1. Not too sensitive.2. You have to touch it correctly in  order to work.3. Accidental touches can occur, little  annoyingi don't know if it is my mobiles problem or zebronics sound bombs problem.it get automatically unpaired from my mobile.sometimes, it is connected but audio cannot be heard. this problems can be ignored.*How to charge Earphoneif you are using only single earphone, charging gets little tricky.just keeping the earphone in the case dose't charge it.you have to take one that is in the case out first. Then, put both of the earphone in the case simultaneously to get it charged.

Infact, i would suggest to go for other renowned brands that give door step service for your product. Saving 100-200 bucks will be compensated here. So think before purchasing this item. I am repenting after buying this product.

  I ordered this product through prime. Got it in a day. First impression of the product was the loose hinge charging case. There were scratches on the earpiece. The call quality wasn't that great. However, I was really impressed by the punchy bass it gives while listening to music. Overall build quality doesn't seem very durable. I wanted a refund, but I have opted for a replacement. Let's just hope that I get a decent product this time.

  Hey everyone! I figured someone has to go and do a review, these are my quick observations immediately after I open and use it for some time. I‚Äôll be going over each item!1) Earbuds- Their make is cheap, nonetheless your ears pain very quickly with higher volume. You could see that the plastics aren‚Äôt well finished, and look kinda not in shape when you wear them!2) Charging Case- plastic again! Certainly not the AirPods we all wanna have but the ones that we end up satisfying ourselves kinda Case. Looks big and will surely have its effect with Jean pockets and may even break in certain scenarios kinda case.3) Packaging- The representation is very poor, cheap one time usable non- biodegradable plastics that are banned in my state TN and has got no QR codes or sorts saying that they‚Äôre biodegradable and truth be told I haven‚Äôt seen one such in an electronic box packaging for a long time.4) Warranty- The company has mentioned it as 1 year in the box but I don‚Äôt see any warranty cards or stuff related to that of any sorts.5) Micro USB- boringggg!CONCLUSION- I am giving it 3 stars for the price they‚Äôve brought it to us which is cool, I paid ‚Çπ899 which is a lightning deal and MRP. ‚Çπ2000.My opinion- I‚Äôm returning them saying they aren‚Äôt fine because it pains Listening music and the EarPods also has a manufacturing defect like there‚Äôs a smudge in the plastic moulded, and overall I‚Äôm not happy that they‚Äôre throwing whatever they could to us Indians for cheaper price. There‚Äôs a standard for tech in INDIA, I hope so! ;)PS. Pictures attached, I don‚Äôt know why they‚Äôre rotated, Sorry and have a nice day! :)

It doesn't fit in charging case which is big turn off and shows the overall product quality.3. Every time you insert earphones inside case, they get new scratch.4. It falls off from ears within 2-3 minutes.Overall product could have been excellent if they would have given attention to build quality.

    Poor Build and No Customer Support are a let-down
  
","









  
  
    
  The product, which is otherwise promising, is let down by a poor build: and I mean VERY poor. The silver coating on the base of each pod and on the buttons comes off very quickly. The black paint/tape/whatever it is is quite uneven too. I had read a review on Amazon saying that the way the pods fit in the case is strange.... and that they have a new scratch on them every time you pull them out. I decided to overlook this because I just needed a cheap pair of pods to listen to audiobooks on the go, and didn't really care much about their fit and finish.However, after two weeks, the right pod, which was already tight, well..... I'll let the pictures say it for you.I sent a message to pTron through their website, and they responded quite quickly, asking for more specifics about the problem. I sent them two messages, along with these pictures. It's been almost two weeks now, and there is NO RESPONSE! I've been trying to contact them for a while, but they don't respond.It's a cheap pair of TWS earpods/buds. That's great, but such abysmally poor quality makes even the price of 899 to expensive for this. Better buy a cheaper Chinese product f you just need something that can last a few months (this one didn't last two weeks for me).To be fair, on a positive note, the sound quality is not so bad. It isn't great by any means, but for the price, if the product had been good in respect of build and customer support, it would have been worth it.

  Placed the order in the month of December and it got delivered in 3 days. Charged it to 100% and then started testing the product.Music - 100% perfectCalls - Not Perfect. As soon as the disconnect the call, it says ""Battery Low"" even after the battery percentage shows 100%.So requested the replacement and the order was totally out of stock and it took me 7- 10 days to get the replacement from Hyderabad Location.After replacement of the product below are the ratings for the product.1. Built Quality - 4.2/5 ( full plastic made) üëç2. Connectivity - 4/5 ( takes longer to connect at initial stage , but when its paired, second time gets connected in seconds, it's obvious with every BT Devices) üëç3. Noise Cancellation - 5/5 üëå4. Calls - 3/5 ( The Only problem with the product is not made for calls, only for listening to music. Same issue happening , once disconnecting the call, says "" battery low"" having 100% of the charging üòî5. Charging - 4/5 ( Takes Hardly 2 -3 hours of charging).üëå6. Battery Backup - 4.5/5 (For me it gave hardly 5 hours of Battery Backup).üëå7.  Bass Sound - 4.8/5 ( Ultimate Bass sound)üëåüëå8. Buds ( Extra ) -  Can't give rating to this as the buds are of totally in different shape.üòîWarranty card isn't provided in the Box, when asked Customer Care about warranty card , they said you can use invoice as a warranty card.Overall, the product has given me 80% of the satisfaction except the Built Quality and Calls issue. (üëåüëåüëå)To be honest, at this budget 899/- , these type of Wireless BT devices can be purchased.Date of Review: 14/07/2020Thank you üòäNote: One Star Less because of the Issue of the calls (as said , it says battery low after disconnecting the call)

    Fully functional bluetooth wireless earphones
  
","









  
  
    
  After using the product extensively for 2 months, I am revising the rating to 4 from 3. The pain is reduced and battery performance is awesome (continuously used for 6.5 hours on international flight). No five star because of (a) poor/no noise cancellation - can‚Äôt really expect NC at this price (b) Average sound quality*******I have been using these for past 1 week now. Here are pros & cons -Pros -1. At Rs 899, its a steal. You can't find another pair of wireless earphones at this price.2. Amazingly smooth connection and pairing. It takes less than 2 sec for the earphones to connect with each other and then pair with mobile.3. Good battery life - so far I have used it continuously for 3 hours. The case provides additional power. I have been using it for 4 to 5 hours every day.4. Good form factor of the casing and the in-casing snap-on charging mechanism5. Fitment is perfect. I have done cycling, jogging and dancing with these on my ears - and they remain snugly fitted without any problem.Cons -1. Sound quality is pretty average for music. If you are music aficionado then these are not for you. But if you just listen to music, not sound quality conscious, then they are okay. For calls, its okay. The mic is a bit patchy, especially if you move around the phone even within the range.2. BLE range is very short, gets disconnected or becomes patchy beyond 6 mt3. Ears start to pain after couple of hour's usage. The earpieces could have been slightly more comfortable. But then its only a Rs 899 earphone4. Form factor - slightly longer (awkwardly longer actually) outside the ear. If you have a small face then it stands out!I would have given 4 star but giving 3 because of the pain in the ear after prolonged usage and not-so-great sound quality. If you have never used wireless earphones and want to try it out, at Rs 899/- nothing comes close.

  Been using them since the 3 or 4 months. Connection is fast. Pairing is also fast. Battery life is just superb.. They keep going on and on. A very big problem though is that the left side is sensitive to cutting out the connection. If you put your hand across the left side while you're using the headphones. But the moment you move your hand out of the way. Then there's no problem. Other than that. They're just perfect. A small niggle if you ask me. For the price. They're really great

  To keep this review really short, don't waste your hard earned money on this unreliable product for following reasons:-1. Pathetic build quality, you take it out of your ear to learn it's broken already (see the pics)2. Mic stopped working only after Amazon return date is over.3. Worst customer service ever (chasing simce more than 3 months and yet no solution)I've not only lost money on this pathetic product but on courier charges for sending this product from Mumbai to Hyderabad due to only one service centre.So if you still want to buy it looking for this price point trap, go ahead buy it if you stay somewhere around its service centre in Hyderabad because that's the place you'll be visiting when you learn about faulty and faltu product.

  Not a good buy and is not the best in quality. Not user friendly because you need to switch on each earplug independently and it gets discharged from 100% to switch off in like ~2.5 hours. Not very useful when you have online meetings most of the time. Also, it some times automatically starts surround sound effects and after a few seconds stops it. Annoying and distracting because of it. It died on me 2 times during my calls in the same day. Not happy.Another problem is, you can connect it with only one device at once.

  ¬†Both pods some times doesn't responds together.pTron Bassbuds lite is quite good in light weight ears buds. It has 10mm driver which provides a great bass for music. Bluetooth connectivity is normal upto 10metres. Sound quality is clear over call too. Mic is too sensitive that it captures the background sounds and highlights is too much so on call it disturbs the other person who's listening. I give ut 4star but 1 more star added for its charging case it's very durable and handy with matte finish and provide 3+cycles to charge buds. Ut takes less than 1hr to get fully charged from 0%(including case).battery backup is quite good. In my case i used it for 6hr+ in 50%volume watching videos. Really appreciate the design it completely fixes in ear and after too many jaults it dosent displaces from the position. Buds are lightweight so it doesn't feels it is inEar.To Operate you need to turn on both buds and wait for 5sec to get both buds paired. Then connect to phones bluetooth and done. It also have auto poweroff feature when you puts buds back in case it automatically turns off the buds and starts charging.It requires 1A/5V charger. If you put higher one it will start heating up so be careful regarding charger

  Performance is Quite good. But the built quality is extremely poor. A part of ear bud got stuck inside of the charging port when I removed the ear bud for very second time. Extremely poor built quality and you can feel it the moment you touch it.And no instructions on warranty claimTheir customer care number is always unattended. After 20 day long email exchanges they offered me to replace it if I courier the product to their warehouse with my money. After that they didn't reply for my emails for a week. Then they told they will send a replacement soon.So after a month of sending my product back , I got a courier from them with a different type of wireless headphones. I found the price is same is the original one, but absolutely uncomfortable and poor sound quality.So now , after 4 months of purchase , I could use the headphone only for 2 days , spend extra money for courier, and have a different product with poor performance on my hand!!New one has poor sound quality , fragile bluetooth connectivity , and non existent noise cancellation

  It's INR 999 folks. Stop looking for airpods like features.I bought them for the purpose of watching tv late at night to avoid disturbing the people sleeping around me. Serves that purpose well.The playback time is impressive, considering the price. Approx 5hrs per charge. The charging case can recharge the ear buds 4 times max on a single charge. At this price those are a definite plus. In ear comfort is good. Never hurt after prolonged use.Fast forward a few months. The only thing that works is the charging case. Both ear phones have stopped charging. Not sure where to go for warranty.

    Good Quality Wireless Ear Buds

  Attending Meetings using Wired Headphones for Work For Home was becoming a pain. So I finally decided to purchase  wireless Bluetooth headphone.The delivery from Amazon was quick despite the covid transport issues and the packaging from the seller was very well knit. The PTron headphones have seamless connectivity with any device they are paired with and offer clean audio with no disruption for a longer period thanks to the low power consumption. This has made  attending long audio conference meetings smoother for me in last few days.The PTron Bassbuds also offer hand free calls with good voice quality which has helped make my phone calls quite easier with my parents who are currently stranded in other city due to a pandemic. The Charge on go case makes charging quite easier and so far I have been able to fully charge it in 90minutes with around 6-7 hours of talk timeOverall the product has been very handy and useful .

  It‚Äôs a must have audio accessory for audio lovers . Ordered this wireless earphone to attend my calls and also for listening to audio. Like the audio quality and found the bass is good . Also the earphones fits in the ear very good and does not fall off while walking. It‚Äôs now my companion for running and walking. The battery lasted for 5 hours with music and about 6 hours on call in a single charge. The charging box provides a good charging so you I do not charge it again and again. Overall satisfied with the price and quality.

  I have been using the product for last 10 days and I must say its awesome.So when i use it for music its 10 out of 10. As the bass and play is good with one or both the buds connected. But when you are traveling and need to use one for safer side as you can't hear anything apart from the music you play.This becomes bad when you are on call. The person at the other end can even hear every noise in the background. So for calling i would say 5 out of 10.Battery backup is good.Charge once and last a decent amount. For people looking for more than 4-5 hrs of battery can look for other product.Other issue i had was though i love everything about the product the ear bud fitting is quite irregular for me as if I smile, the product falls off.  So i have to keep a straight face to use it.

  I didn't expect much when I bought these cz the price was less but these came out amazing. Really good sound, i hear pop songs so the bass was good too. Volume is really good. The case is matte and looks really good. Only thing lacking is battery life, if you only listen songs then it will last you 4 hours and if you attend a lot of calls with songs then 3 hours. For this you can use one bud at a time and keep other in the pod for charging and replace when the battery in other pod dies.

  Its been now more than 2 months and I want to be very specific about my review.Considering the price the buds are good, but the quality of the product is not consistent.1st purchase received damaged product as 1 ear bud was not at all working. So as the policy i received a replacement from the seller.Now the ear buds were working fine but then after almost 2 months of use (actually less than 2 months) again right ear bud stopped working. Now since it passed the 10 days replacement policy of Amazon i had to contact the company for warranty.Its been more than 20 days and there is no response from the company.They have a so called customer care number, but whenever you call that number its always busy.After a long thought I personally came with an understanding that if we need a after sale service then go with the reputed brand, i know they are expensive than these, but at least you have a guaranty  that you are getting post sales service.Again its the individuals choice what to and what not to buy, but if anyone looking for a suggestion then mine would be straight, buy only reputed company products.

  So good one. Don't go for negative reviews. All are paid ones. Easily gets connected. Easy fit in ear. Balanced weight. Weightless too.One thing is the mic absorbs noise also. So if u r in noisy place talk via phone mic and speaker. If u r in room or a bit quite place, u can talk easily. But for the price this is really good.Who will give high decibel speaker with mic and 5 to 6 hrs of playback(I even watched 2 films at a stretch without any problems or charge)...

  I bought PTron Bassbuds Lite couple of days back and I am extremely satisfied with the product.First thing one watches while buying earphones or headphones is the sound quality of the product and after using extensively PTron Bassbuds Lite, I can assure you that these buds doesn‚Äôt disappoint you in this area. The sound is decent with good bass, decent voice and instrument separation and noise reduction.Other thing one looks for while buying a Bluetooth earphones or headphones is the battery backup. With 50mAh Li-Polymer Battery (each earbud), it easily lasted for more than 5 hours with extensive calling and music listening. This is more than the competitors in this and the higher price range are. In addition, the case comes with 400mAh battery; this gives you almost 4 cycles of full charging of Bassbuds Lite. The voice quality during the calls was clear and excellent at both the ends.Detailed Review:Sound: As said above, it gives a nice experience of listening music with distortion free bass from different genres.Design: I bought a black colour variant and matt finish look of the Bassbuds Lite impressed me in the given price range. It is light in weight and easy to carry with case.Battery: The 50mAh Li-Polymer Battery (each earbud and 400mAh Charging cum Carrying Case astonished me with the battery backup at heavy usage.Connectivity: The connectivity is good and fast and I have not faced any issues with the connectivity.Calling: With noise reduction and an inbuilt microphone, Bassbuds Lite give a astound experience while callingFit: It comes in a size that can be easily fitted in any ear perfectly. In addition, it comes with different sets of rubber buds to fit in properly with the shape of your ears.At the price point, it is good value for money. I will definitely recommend it to others.

  After testing it for 3 days i'd came up with a very conclusive review. There are 4 factor which we expect most in any buds is battery backup, comfort fit, sound quality and bass. So if we look at its fit the earbuds get fit so nicely that it'll block noise from surround. The sound quality is good but not great and that's what you get at this price point.  Sometimes it feels noisy and distorted during calls but that's okay. The bass is very great. Ans this product easily last 4 hours per charge and you can charge 4 times from its given box. Lastly i would conclude that , at this price point the product is perfect. Else who knows how much will it last long.

  This is my second purchase.Best suitable for kid's attending online classes.Not for listening to music. No bass.Not for talking as the microphone is of very low quality. The listener at the receiving end hears it with a very hollow undertone.The earphone cushions are of cheap plastic like a balloon material. one got torn while changing. Removing and changing the cushion is cumbersome. Needs effort.However It gives an elegant look while wearing.The fitting into the ear canal is perfect. Doesn't fall when you choose the right size of the cushion.Charging case is very cute with different LED color lights for charging  and and while in use.Tap gestures on the earphones comes handy and funtion well.It serves my purpose to the fullest with a real value for the money!!

Distance between my TV and my couch is less than 15 feet. Overall product works awesome when used in close range when used with mobile. For SmartTv this one is not an joyful experience. Also, pains ear as the ear piece after some time as the bulged part of the earphones as shown in attached pictures is not designed for comfortable long time use.

  If you want a basic pair of truly wireless stereo headphones, these are perfect. The pairing was straight forward and sound quality is satisfactory. Keep in mind that these are very basic earphones and do not provide the quality that is even remotely comparable to that of B&O, Sennheiser or Sony. But for the price they are asking, I could not fault them.Positives:+ Cheap+ Easy pairing+ Left and Right are in perfect sync.+ No drops so far.+ Decent battery life+ Decent sound quality.+ Enough loudness+ ComfortableNegetives:- Flimsy- The chrome garnish is actually paint and will fade away in a week revealing the white plastic underneath- The mircophone is too weak. So you'll have to speak louder if you are attending a call- Sometimes the LED on the charging unit fail to turn off.

  Pros:1. Fits well in the ear and does not cause any discomfort.2. Audio quality is satisfactory especially when looked at what you pay for it. Voice clarity is good, bass is soft and soothing. Treble and highs are heard.3. Works well with laptop and mobile.4. Pairing is quick and easy.5. Batt backup seems to ok,ok. Haven't measured exact time.Cons:1. Let's accept that it is damn cheap for a TWS, so don't expect the build and finish to be great. While it is more than acceptable for the amount paid, the durability of the case and the earbuds is a big ?.2. Some fancy features like touch control and water/sweat proof not available.

  I am writing this review after using it for 2 months. Sound and Bass quality is good while you listen to music. For calls, you can hear the sound what other person is taking but I often hear complaints from other side that they can't hear me clearly. So the mic is not very good. There is no noise cancellation. Absolutely disappointed with noise cancellation. If you are walking outside and using your patron bass buds to talk to another person....then there is no way you or the other person can hear you. You will hear complaints from other side that you are not audible. Yes, price is cheaper...but only good for music.

  There are a few genuises who like to compare this with apple's airpods which are only 14 grand pricier than this one item, ignoring those geniuses you will find this item fits your needs and purposes. This one seems like a rip-off of apple product but the price difference does matter.1. it is true I felt a bit pain in the ear after some time of listening music at high volume, but are you sure it ownt happned on apple airpods, that is the nature of in ear hearing.2. Cheap plastic: well plastic is plastic and it is used because it is cheap. And is there any expensive plastic ?? And even if it is there do I care ?? well no as long as the build quality is great do I need to care ?? the build quality is very good though.3. The angle of speaker placement is probably best, dont know if this is also a rip off from apple product.4. Overall very good finish  that makes it look like a branded item and not like a cheap chinese product.

  ¬†While ordering earphones (TWS), I was really skeptikal about which ones to order and ended up ordering ptronn Bassbuds lite. They are super stylish and compact. They come with a micro USB charging cable. The battery life is also very long lasting , I am using it continuously now for 3 days and charged it just ones so you can just forget about charging it and use it freely.It is also light weight, which is good if you want to carry it around. It offers good noise cancellation for this price point. The bluetooth connectivity is also fast, as soon as I take it out of the case, it gets connected. I would suggest everyone to go for it if you are looking for a budget friendly TWS.

  Firstly i ordered this product seeing lot many reviews and purchases as i was looking for a wireless ear buds.1. The charging cable is not fitting into the pin. Very bad experience with it.2. The sound quality is bit upsetting as i expected a smooth and loud bass. But its just giving a sharp tincture kind of sound which is although loud with volume increase but the bass beats feel is missing. Feels like the sound is coming from somwhere far. Not exact feel into the ears which shud ideally a ear phone  is meant for.3. The box is so delicate. I thought its a magnet type of closing box but its like a pencil box.But the box looks good.4. Ear buds are little bit falling off after some time.5. Otherwise the making and all are good and budget friendly.(Do not compare with any other brands as each one has its own making and features).6. Finally just pick it according to your requirement.

  So I'm super impressed!! I received these today and have been totally impressed by the ptron buds so far. I've been listening for 2 hours so far and this is my immediate feedback. 1. The charging case is way smaller 2. The actual earpieces are way smaller 3. The overall fidelity is robust & have a great baseline through to treble range. 4. I can easily hear the person with whom I'm speaking when making phone calls and the person with whom I'm speaking said they could hear me well too. 5. Overall packaging presentation as a first impression was great. 6. Pairing with my phone was very easy. 7. I've been listening for 2 hours so far and the battery level has remained at a high level which suggests their claim of up to 14 hours charge seems to be right! So first impressions are a great experience and renews my faith in ptron.

  Value for money but Sound is too loud even though i have run my TV in minimum sound possible , same with mobile sound to be kept minimum, continious noise also heared with sound which is erritating with extended period of use, range is 7 meter only as claimed 10 meter , sound connect and deconnect frequently even pairing device is 3 meter away, but we cannit accpet more in this price. I also take trial connecting two device at a time in indivisual earbud and it is succefull- so i am able to hear TV in one ear and mobile music in another ear same time which is successful.

    Good earphone for daily use.
  
","









  
  
    
  For daily use and phone calls it's good earbuds. Comes in decent cost as well and with matt finish.Pros1. Good matt finish and good in terms of looks and finishing.2. Nice sound quality and phone call sound.3. Once paired with your phone it will automatically connects whenever u start next time.4. Automatically starts once u remove earbuds from case and paires.5. Once charged can work for 8-10 hours in idle time.Cons1. Noise cancellation is not upto mark.2. Plastic material so there is always chance to broke if it's drop from certain height.3. Will pain in ears if it's wore for too long.4. The pairing remain good at distance of 2-3 meters of phone and not beyond that.My suggestion is to wear one earbud at a time and not more than 2-3 hours continuously. Wear both together only if u wanna see movie.

  The earpods I received were in immaculate condition and their finishing too was exceptionally good. They pair well with my old Samsung phone too. The only drawback is that the opposite person isn't able to hear me clearly through the it's microphones and if I cup my hands over it, the opposite person hears an echo.The microphones should have been positioned in the front instead of the sides. Otherwise it's a very nice pair of earpods.

  It worked excellently for a week. On day 8th one of the ear buds has stopped working.  And obviously I was not expecting this to happen so I had gotten rid of the packing it came in ; so I can't even return it for a replacement. My advice to all the prospective buyers is to hold on to the packng it comes in.  Who knows.  U might be needing it. As I do now.

Elegant look, adorable case and perfect sound.If you face any issue connecting it, just put the buds in the magic box and you will find it working, though i faced this trouble once in a blue moon. Enjoying. Got to buy another piece to gift my father.

  Look it's good. It is a good product but if you compare it with a 4000 or like some dumb people 24000 rupees wireless earbuds then you might complain a lot. Yes, you can get a better sounding wired earphone in this price but if you want a truely wireless earbud within this price range then you can definitely check it out. As I said the sound quality is not mindblowing but except that the other features are really good. I've been using this for couple of days and in my case the bluetooth connection,microphone and the call quality was really nice. So if you know that a 1000 rupees product should never be compared to a 5000 rs. product then you can buy this with no hesitation.

It does the job pretty well.Even tried it in single mode. Works great. In the middle of call put one of the pod in case. Sound drop was for 1 sec and mic switched to another pod. Tried doing vice versa, same within 1 sec it switch. So overall it's decent package, in this price range

  While everything seems to be okay - the right earbud would not charge. Returned it after 3 days.Too many people have complained about it. Makes me question how much this would last.I suggest that it's better to buy from Boat - by just paying a little extra but with a guarantee of a standard product.Or the next alternative of Realme earbuds - which is on the expensive side though.

It also connect very fast. The audio quality is amazing as compared to price, It also supports 8D songs or music which is the missing feature in most of the Bluetooth earbuds. Its auto connect feature when taking out of the charging case and auto power off when put into charging case save a lot of time. I can also use one at one time for calling because they both have microphone. It one year Manufacturing warranty feel me Relax. Best earbuds which I ever used. You must try this.

  At first I was suspicious if all the features they told were true seeing the price it was at. I bought it for 4k during Great India Sale (29th Sept 2019). This launched just then and had no reviews. But once I received them and tested it , I can say that they are awsome. All the features written are legit and the sound quality exceeded my expectations.Pros:1. Battery life is very long.2. There is an lcd screen to show the battery percentage remaining. This is really good feature.3. Sound quality is good.4. There is touch control and these fit really good in ears. They don't fall off.Cons:I just felt the hindge to open the buds case is a little fragile.Will update after using it for some more time.

  I was searching for a good TWS ear pods for a such a long time. I orderdd this product when there was no  review at all. It was just launched. Being a gogi tech follower. I thouht of giving it a chance seeing the features and mainly the coolest lighting effect. Oooh god at night you will see yourself glazing in the crowd. People gonna surely notice the unique kinda earbuds and everything is premium about this. Sound quality , bass, connection in my one plus 7 pro is so fast that even before i wear the ear pods it gets connected. Once you charge the battery case forget to plug back for 1 week atleast.Very efficient battery back up. I think continuosly being in a call can suck the battrry of ear pods in 6 hours.  Dont worry Put it back in the case for sometime and its ready again. I use it for phone call most of the times rather than listening songs by the way. And believe me this ear pods lets you talk to anyone keeping the phone in another room and you can be in washroom , kitchen , working. No prolm at all. Making my life easy and comforting. I cant wonder for more in such a price.Thanks Wings .

Thats it...!!!Due to this small setting The bass gose UP and thrilled sounds come outh of earpods and noise cancellation also improved.DONT USE DEFAULT EARBUDS TIPS BASS WILL NOT GET. IF YOU COMFORTABLE WITH DEFAULT TIPS THEN YOU CANüôèüôèi am using Large pair. Now i am very Happy to here the sound so much lovely powerpods i have seen even after TAGG ZEROG.ON THE BOX:-you will get GAANA subscription card. Dont know for how much time.Pros :-1.Connectivity is very fast and Good.2.sound quality and base is very impressive with large pair of tips.3. Fast charging earpods.4. Touch control is also buttery smooth. TAGG ZEROG controls are pathetic.5.Small display is very gorgeous and Crystal clear like MI BAND 3.6. Nicely Occupy In the helmet while bike riding tested on VEGA SOPORT.7. Blinking light feels like powerpods on the next level.8.""MADE IN INDIA"" JAI HIND JAI BHARAT.Cons:-1.1st time you will have to learn how to exactly were earpods in the ears. See my shared pics for proper fitting.2. Extra eartips quality must be better. It might be  for softness purpose.3. Powerpods material little bit sleepy. U have to take care of it.Believe Me this is the best earbods under 4000/-With good touch control, brilliant sound quality, and more than sufficient battery backup.Use Some third party Application for music likePOWERAMP, SYELLIO music player.Thanks...!!!!üòäüòä

  In all other respects, the product is quite good. Met all expectations. Of course I have used it only for a day. Will edit if there is any issue over time.However, I was really disappointed to see it is NOT made in India. It is imported from somewhere and there is no mention of where it is made.This is important because one of the main reasons I chose this over brands was that it is made in India. Multiple websites said this, falsely I now know, and even Wings' official communications subtly implied that.Be aware when you buy this product.Otherwise, sound quality, it's functions (e.g. Quality of bluetooth connectivity etc) are quite good. Happy with the product itself.Update after using it for a day: I returned the product! I called their service helpline number 3 times for minor clarifications. The line disconnected every time. I registered the product within a few hours of receiving it. There was no acknowledgement on mail or SMS. And I had chosen it over other brands because many reviews created the impression it is 'made in india'. Turns out it is imported. Box only said it is imported to India but location was not indicated. Most probably from China like most electronics nowadays. Felt like I had been played.

  ProsReally good battery. Works hours. Sound has good base. Mids and Treble good. But base takes higher side.ConsThe biggest defect for me is that I could not wear for longer hours. The outer ear ridge started paining and causing discomfort due to its design.This problemnmay be perticularlybto to me based on my ear cavity. Maynot be same for others.Other than that it is very nice when compared to other products.

  If i have to rate it then i would rate it like thatBUILD QUALITY-5/5(both,the case and earbuds are of great quality,you won't feel you are holding a budget tws earphones)SOUND QUALITY- 4.5/5(in terms of bass it is excellent also the vocals and instrument separation is quite good)CONNECTIVITY- 4/5BATTERY BACKUP- 5/5(if i can give more than 5 out of 5 i would definitely give it coz the battery backup is extremely great)CONTROLS AND EASE-5/5(touch works great better than expected)MIC QUALITY-3.5/5(it works bad outside i mean like in very crowdy place or near the road)ONE THING THAT YOU WANT TO KNOW IS THE POWER BANK FEATURE WHICH THE BRAND ALSO PROMOTES OF THESE EARPHONES,SO IT IS JUST USELESS COZ THE CASE ONLY HAVE 2500 MAH BATTERY WHICH IS GOOD FOR THE EARBUDS BUT WORTHLESS FOR CHARGING MOBILE PHONES.IT'S OUTPUT POWER IS SO LOW FOR EXAMPLE- I HAVE ASUS ZENFONE MAX PRO M1 WHICH COMES WITH THE CHARGER WITH 10W OUTPUT IT CHARGES MY PHONE FROM 0 TO 100% COMPLETELY IN 2.5-3 HOURS AMD WHEN I TRY TO CHARGE MY PHONE BY CASE OF THESE EARPHONES,MY PHONE SHOWS THAT IT WILL TAKE 12 HOURS TO CHARGE THE PHONE FROM 15 TO 100%.SO IT IS VERY SLOW AT CHARGING PHONES WHICH I WILL NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO DO.ANYWAY THE CHOICE IS YOUR'S NOW I THINK I COVERED ALL THE THINGS WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW ABOUT THESE TWS EARPHONES.

  After using for less than two months, the left pod output volume fell drastically and now it‚Äôs very unpleasant to listen to music due to unbalanced volumes from both sides, called customer care on number ‚Ä≠91302 56537‚Ä¨ but there was no response..I don't have any idea now of how to initiate for warranty replacement.Sent the product on my own expenses as I was promised replacement, however after about one week of receiving the product the technical team informs me that it‚Äôs due to physical damage. It‚Äôs really disgusting, as I never mishandled and rarely used it. There is no scratch or crack on the product which can prove that it‚Äôs due to physical damage and still it wasn‚Äôt replaced, wish I had option to give it a zero star.

  I already have Bose wireless Bluetooth Earphones but I wanted to try this as it is MADE IN INDIA. I would say this is worth it but yes the sound quality can't be compared with Bose but it is definitely worth the price.Pros:1) Battery Life. It is awesome, once charged it goes 3-4 days easily2) Digital indicator of Charge left3) Both earbuds are active sound even during calls too unlike Bose (In Bose, only one right earbud is active for calls)4) Charging case can also be used to charge your phone5) Price is a big plusCons:1) Touch sensor were a little troubling for me. As when I used to try to adjust the earbuds, touch sensor used disconnect call or music.

  One thing wrong and the whole product turned into scrap. WINGS please tell me which marketing guy or the product designer has forced you to mandate this light effects, Trust me these bright neo light effects will make it almost not operable in any descent formal meeting and in night condition. Very wrong step of the company.Although apart from this sound is awesome, size is compact but the call quality is not satisfactory.

  Rating 8.5/10 (1.5 deducted for connectivity issue)Using the pods for 10 days.Experience is quite good.1. Build Quality: Pods are plastic yet attractive. The led indicator really looks good. Case is very premium in looks and quality.2. Battery Backup: Well, the case is a tiny power bank, so if you are gonna use it solely for charing the pods, it will last crazy. Also the pods provides average 6 hours of play support.3. Connectivity: See, the pairing is smooth both among the pods themselves and with phone. But But But, the range is very disapponiting and merely support max 6 feet.4. Sound Quality: Trust me, they are hype loud, very clear (to a general listener), balanced and bass heavy. One thing, don't get stressed if the sound on pods is low even after maximising the volume of your phone. Just keep the right pod pressed untill your desired volume is reached (i got worried too, initially).5. Fit : Don't trust any negative reviews about fit. The fit trick is in the Earbuds and not in Pods. Just put those buds that dig deepest in your ears. I use to sprint a lot in gym still the never fell or loosened. Perfect fit6. Touch: Simply, Woww.7. Value for Money: Its Bang for every penny spent.

  Finally I found earbuds which is satisfactory for an audiophile like me. I was searching for a good one which gives a decent bass in addition to producing crystal clear sounds. Tried Baas Dots N21 and Crossbeats Urban. Even though their reviews were positive, I didn't quite found them good enough to my liking. Returned them and then I found Wings Powerpods. Great product indeed. Plus the power bank function of Charging Case is an irresistable deal.Make sure the earbuds are charged before you use it for the first time. Mine came with no charge and I was thinking my phone was having trouble finding them. Once they were charged, phone connected them easily!Haven't tested battery.  I'm guessing they are good enough.

  Brought 2 wings earbuds, one for myself and for bro in law. After using for 19 days. Here is my experience so far.- I charge it full 100% and it last for 18 days. Only today I had to charge for second time.- it connect to my phone the moment I open the case. It‚Äôs that fast to connect.-the sound quality is another level. It‚Äôs very clear during call and great experience listening music.- it is very comfortable, they will give extra rubber to adjust on different ear size.- I had been wearing for hour on bike ride on rainy day. It work okay with rain drop.Things that also need to be know=- I experience earbuds get disconnected Sometime out of nowhere. But tn it reconnect again. It happen once in while.- the touch connection react wn I lay on pillow. So wn I shift and move around. Sometime it increase volumes, reduce volume or play next songs.So other tn these 2 minor issue. The ear buds work awesome. I love how long the battery last and how clear the sound is...  its worth every penny I paid for.Hope my review help u in making right choices.

  When I decided to buy a wireless ear pod, studied a lot about different available products in the market, finally decided to go with full touch control ear pods, including sound control, most of the well-known brands in the market are not having that feature,1. Where WINGS Powerpods providing full touch control for all the call features, (Answering, End call, & Reject Call), for music we can play, pause, next song, & previous song also, Siri & Google voice assistance, along with volume controls, everything you can control from pods with touch, it's awesome. very responsive.2. Size Very Cute, perfect fit in the year, we can use under helmet. (Just to describe the mentioned, not suggested while driving to listen to music or talking over the phone due to noise cancellation ).3. Passive Noice Cancellation is good.4. Sound quality is Awesome. ( Earlier I have tried RHA MA 650 which nothing in front of this )5.TWS(True Wireless Stereo technology) Pods when can use each pod individually.6. Earlier I am a bit worried about the LED indicator on the pod, show it looks but its stunning, I love it.7. Bluetooth Audio Codec is SBC, Stereo Channel Mode.8. Battery Capacity Since it's my 3rd day, I did not get a chance to drain them completely. Digital Display on the case looks good. the case is also very small.Cons...1.hindge of the case is a little fragile.2. Occasionally Observed connection issues, when you pick out from the case, not immediately & automatically connected. Solutions for this wait a couple of seconds once after opening the case then LED indicator of both the pods will blink once then you can pick out and use them.In this price range, this is the best product in the market, I can proudly say that its made in India product.

    Mediocre.
  
","









  
  
    
  I have been using them for around a week now, so I'll share my experience until now. The quality is mediocre with lots of things that can be improved. Build quality is ok and the case seems sturdy. Overall I found them barely justifying the price. If I had to buy again I would probably look for more choices than I did. They are rated much higher than they deserve. I'll list down the pros and cons to justify my verdict.Pros- Battery Life is quite good- Base is good- The microphone is good enough and I didn't face any problems- Comfortable to wear. The design is a bit weird to get used to at first.Cons- Once disconnected I have to try multiple times before they connect again. Very very irritating and a trait of low quality.- The sound at high pitch is very discomforting, like nails on a blackboard.- When I remove them, the music starts playing on my laptop instead. No way, I am going to use them in the office.- The touch controls are too sensitive and badly placed. They get triggered even when you are just removing the buds or wearing them again.Update:  Downgrading from 3 stars to 2 stars after more than a month of use. I have discovered new problems In addition to the one stated above. The charging percentage is very buggy.- A lot of times the charge % on the charging box stays 100% and never reduces. And then it suddenly becomes discharged.- Similarly, once or twice, the pods also gave no battery warning even though I had charged them fully and the charging box was showing 100%.

  To start with, The Earpods come in a very beautiful looking case which shows the charge percentage. The ear pods and very comfortable and all the features are available as mentioned in the description. The battery backup is really impressive as I have listened to 30 min music and still shows 100%. It also very well connects to google assistant and the response rate is very quick. I have bought it as a gift to someone. I'm in love with it that I am thinking to buy another one for myself.

  So after doing a lot if research i decided to order Wings Powerpods and i am quite happy with my decision.  Cost me INR 3,800.I have no words for the quick delivery of Amazon, tentative date was 5 days but i received them the very next day of order. Love your service Amazon, truly customer centric.So, the Hierarchy goes like this,- Apple is leading the race. If you have that good a budget, please proceed to buy them, nothong compares to them as on date.- Then Samsung comes 2nd in race which is very light,  Comfortable and provides an overall good sound quality but that too will cost you around 10K.- Then Sony costing around 8K, good quality, but heavy and big in size (not recommended)- Then comes all your MI, Oppo, Realme, Blaupunkt etc. Some have Design issues, some sound quality.  At these price range, Boat could be a fair choice costing around 2K and has average Quality sound, good connectivity.*Imp. : Pls don't go Portronics, they may be cheap but connectivity issues will be there.- Then i landed upon 'WINGS Powerpods', the cost is bit on a higher side as to the general brands in 2K range but Quality and finish...my goodness.# Considering the small size of these Pods, they have got a real real good Bass# Connectivity is veryyy good, no disconnection issues# The LED indicators on both the Pods are so Elegant and looks very classy. They do look very premium.# Because the LED glows variably, people are gonna notice you a lot,  that too is worth a premium feel. So if you like to boast your Tech. around, these might be just the right choice.# The charging case is very sturdy, Perfect finish.# Battery LED indicator comes up as soon you open the charging case and remains for time.# As you might have seen in Description, battery backup is real large, you can keep on using them for long hours.# If Battery goes down, pop 1 pod in charging case and meanwhile keep using the other.These Pods sits between Samsung Quality and almost half the Prize. Very strongly recommended.

  I have been using this product for past few days, first when i pushed it into my ears and listened to my favourite song, there was not enough bass, i thought OMG! what have i bought, then i changed the ear plugs to check if it helps and the last one did changed my hearing experience.Pros.The sound is too best with bass.The Pods have lights for those effects, too good.Runtime realtime, 4 hours non -stop, thereafter, it dies, one at a time.The charging case doesnt need to be charged all the time, its a week and i have not charged it.(Depends on usage too)Cons:*The connecting range is very poor, if you move away from phone then it starts to distort sound in about 12-13 feet, if there is a wall in between, then the sound breaks even in 4 feet.*After few hours the ears starts to hurt, as the pods are little heavy for long use.S*lightly buldgy, as the pods pods pops out of your ear.Overall, i liked it very much.

  Superb product! I wasn't expecting such a good quality product considering the price and unfamiliar brand name.Pros --Very premium fininshing-Light weight-Fits the ear very well, doesn't fall off or feel heavy in the ear after a while-best battery backup (even compared to expensive brands like Sony or Samsung since they have active noice cancellation which drains alot of battery!)-the LED is very attractive and looks futuristic-sound quality is reasonably good. There is flat response across all frequency, bass is decent. I am an audiofile and sound is of a priority for me and this earpod has satisfied my need reasonablyCons --unfamiliar brand hence don't know the long term performance, warranty services etc-the charging is via micro USB. I would prefer type C as all the phones in my house are on type C, so I have to keep the extra cable for charging this earpodI haven't mentioned about the battery as I havnt yet got a chance to use these for a long time and test the battery. It seems like the manufacturers claim is true based on a few hours that I have used this.Will update this review after a few weeks usage

    Not for sound quality. Features and build are its USP.
  
","









  
  
    
  Discount:Bought it for 3,799INR. Wait for sales. It is still overpriced at this rate in terms of sound quality.Features:i) Sound:Constant disturbance in the background. Low volume. Slightly above-average bass and treble.I have both Wings Alpha and PowerPods and somehow, Alpha had a higher volume than these.The background static is really a spoil at lower volumes and high volumes produce sharp loudness, which hurt the ears.Call quality has been a random experience. Sometimes it was good, but other times there was echo (tested at the same location).Noise cancellation is better than average, however, not good for crowded, noisy places.ii) ComfortFits perfectly. No complaints in this department. Prolonged use have sometimes irritated my ears, but I think it's the same case with every earbud (or maybe not).iii) Touch controlNo complaints. It has the standard controls (unlike Alpha) with double tap to change song and long press for volume. The touch zone is also easy to access because of the concave design at the surface of earbuds.iv) BatteryNo complaints. The earbuds along with the charging case have almost undepleting batteries. If you have the habit of putting earbuds in the case when not using, you'll never run out of charge on these.The digital meter on the charging case is a huge help too.v) ConnectivityAutoconnects most of the times. No complaints.vi) Build qualityExcellent. Both earbuds and charging case look premium.Why I will returned these:Because of low volume, background noise, unsyncronized lights on the earbuds. Wearing them in the dark makes you look like a fool because first the right earbud lights up, then the left one. Really bad for something costing almost 4k.Final words:Maybe I received a faulty unit, that's why my experience has been poor, but I think if sound quality is your priority better go for established brands like JBL, Bose, etc. This one was better than Wings Alpha, but worse than other earphones I've used. Better alternatives are available in terms of sound quality. However, it terms of style, this one is definitely one of the best looking earbuds (except for the unsync lights, which really gets noticed a lot)I'm looking to buy Crossbeats Pebble after this.

  This is an honest review after using this TWS for 2 days. Definitely the sound quality is very good. But if you are buying this TWS for BASS, I won't recommend it.PROS:1. Good sound quality, Recommended for watching content only.2. Good fit, It won't come out from your ear easily.3. Touch controls are pretty responsive.4. The power backup is very good.CONS:1. Low Bass, don't believe in advertisements.2. Connectivity issue, Bluetooth range is less than 10 Meters.3. Not good for voice calls.

  I will not repeat what others have written already. I was very happy with my decision to buy these wireless in-the-ear-earphones for 4k during the great Indian sale, designed in India and what not. When I first tried to wear them, the default rubbers won't fit. Luckily they had a plethora more inside. I picked up the smallest one of them. And the only complaint that I had for the next two months were, 1. Poor/none noise cancelliation, 2. The microphone pics up a lot of noise from around, during phone calls, making it impossible to use the earbuds during phone calls. These issues, I made my peace with over the days. Fast forward to today, when I took out the left bud, to my surprise I couldn't find the rubber on it. I freaked out. Surely, it must be inside my ear. I showed it to my friends. They couldn't see it. I didn't find the rubber anywhere else, so I just to be sure, I went to the doctor. And sure enough, it was in there. She managed to get it out after some toil, and not without the process being hurtful. Anyway, here I am, writing a review, while my left ear bleeds. :) Don't think I will using rubber end earphones again

  Amazing powerpods. I didn't expect it to be so satisfyingly premiumly amazing. I was a bit skeptical in the beginning, no proper reviews in YouTube (at least from the few trusted tech channels), but I went with my gut for  these pair of cool looking earbuds.I connected my Iphone 6s with Wings Powerpods and here's how it turned out, they fit perfectly into your ear even while working out or running on treadmill with the right pair of earbuds (3 pairs given to select from). Noise cancellation is not too good not too bad. It works though. They look premium, sound quite good, music and bass is amazing. Battery life is unparalleled, especially in this price range. I use my powerpods for 3-4 hours everyday and with 100% charged case, it took 21 days to drain the case to 11% from 100%. BTW, even after using for 4 hours continuously, the charge in powerpods remains, as they never got discharged in my ears. The add-on, you can charge your phone with the case as the case itself has 2500 mAh battery. Have to check it using longer. The case is sleek, light-weight and beautiful with half matt finish and other half glossy.The only drawback if any would be the not so great call quality, don't get me wrong, it's decent, gets the job done as i said before. And If these aren't enough to convince you into buying them, there's a small matter of a digital battery percentage display on the charging case.

Other person on call complaints everytime for low voice.Design- Design is good, and fits in ears well. Light weighted. LED reminds me my shoes in past days üòÖüòÖTouch-  Very good, works everytime.Price-  I got this in just 3200. But I should under 3000‚Çπ product.Overall it is a worthy INDIAN product with less Cons. For those, who loves music and want to go wireless. It's a amazing.  Jai HindRating-4.2/5

  Worsssssst product, please don't go for this. Its mentioned in the spec that it will work within 10 meters, bit it's not even covering 3 meters. Even in indoors the volume is veryyyy lesss, there is absolutely no bass at all. The battery got drained within 1.5 hours of usage, also the case charges the buds only for 2 times, not like it's mentioned 10 times we can able to charge.The volume down/up controls not working t ll, i dont see anything good regarding this product. The worst thing is I'm unable to replace/refund this item, Amazon is not allowing me to do this. This will be my last purchase on Amazon, the worst shopping experience ever i faced.Please don't go for this rubbish product, also if possible don't use Amazon.

  When I got the pods, I was very happy as everything was good with these. I was using it for 1 or 2 hrs everyday and after 2 months of use, these showed their true colours. The sound in left piece is barely heard. Tried power off and on multiple times but I use. Raised a request with the customer care and they said they will pickup the product in 4 days. It's been 2 weeks now and they stopped responding to me call and messages now. Pls avoid these. Don't waste your money on these.

  I received the defective product from the seller. The voice breaks in earbuds. I requested return at the same day. The product description says deep bass, but the bass is not good at all. Noise cancellation is good. Overall sound quality is also fine. The sounds are too loud and hence break at full volume and loses the crisp and clarity. Calling was okay but my friend also ordered the same and he faced calling issues. I think the seller sends the already returned product as a new one, i dont know not sure. But very disappointed.

  Built quality is great... Sound quality is amazing... I previously owned anker liberty lite and i was amazed with wings sound quality and comfort... Battery life is just amazing, i once used these earbuds continously for like 16-17 hours with just 10-15 minutes of charging twice and they never got out of charge . The only downside (according to me) is led lighting on the earbuds. Lights can sometimes be irritating while using at night(btw led lights on earbuds are very bright). To cover the lights i used vinyl wrap and that was the only solution to stop the lights from blinking.Highly recommended üëç

TIP:- to turn off a bud just put in case or click once  and long hold on the touch of the budCONS1.Have very bad comfortablilty while wearing a good safety helmet , its irritating2.The mike does not pick up sound well while your on a call outside ( inside its normal like any other)3.it feels a bit uncomfortable to wear after a long period of usage (above 4 hrs)OVERALL i give it a 4.4/5 ,, definitely a good pods for the price rangeP.S i never wrote such a long review XD

I liked the 2500 mah battery, it is HUGE and case can charge earpods 10 times and due to big battery it feels heavy and premium with a digital display to show battery juice left, heavy , Premium, compact, good sound, call quality is also good (indoors )  and okok in traffic, we can drive bike and use this earpods and we wont hear any traffic noise and air sounds, very goodpassive noise cancellation.

  Have been using this product for a week now. Gambled and ordered this product since there r no reviews by any main stream reviewer online. When I first plugged this tws to my ears it didn't fit and sound was not good so thought to return it. But I changed earbuds and kaboom! it fit perfectly in my ears. The bass is quite good you will get the boom boom pow, noise cancellation could have been better but it's just right for me. I've watched a complete movie on this and my ears didn't pain a bit. Battery life of earphone is excellent, the case is very mesmerizing. The case is little heavy at around 200gms but the LED battery indicator is awesome,like hey it really helps when I know how much % is left and don't have to use my brain to guess when I have to charge the case. I got it for 4.5k with discount(it was displaying 3.5k discount) but in few reviews i saw the price is around same for about a year... So the discount is a clickbait. Would definitely recommend buying this product if you are on a tight budget but still wanna be cool and gotta lay ur hands on the latest tech to feel not left beyond. üëçüèº

  Not so good according to the price. You're paying all the money for only the battery backup and its definitely pretty impressive. But the sound is not loud compared to other bluetooth headset. Noice cancellation is very bad. The touch response is quite accurate though and works most of the time. I say if you're looking for a TWS which gives a tremendous battery backup then go for it but keep in mind its doesn't come with a Type-C port.

  The first time they sent an older product(red box), the specification on Amazon say that this has low latency gaming mode, but that is not available in the first product they sent, moreover they was a product defect where the charge of the left bud drops drastically within 3.5 hrs. Then I have asked for a replacement they sent a July 2020 manufactured product(green box). This has two modes gaming and music mode, however I'm still disappointed as the charge drop issue is happening with the right earpod.This seems to be a product defect that the company knows about because if you read the instructions it says as soon as you hear battery low, put it for charge...if you wait for a couple more times for the 'Battery Low' message, one of the pod will disconnect and you will see that the other pod connects to your phone back with around 50% charge. And this lasts for another 3hrs.I have bought it during the sale for a little lesser than the regular price, but looks like Amazon is just trying to circulate damaged product till someone not so techy just accepts it. It happened twice. Didn't expect this to happen....'twice'. If you look at the third image you can see that when the box first cam itself it looks like it's used because part of the LED indicators are worn out.Coming to the look of the product, it really looks very stylish and feels classy. Bass is up to the mark, very disappointed that I am just returning it now.May be in the future if they rectify this issue and release a better product I will be buying it.But for this one, not worth the money, hands down.

  I was searching for a good TWS ear pods for a such a long time. I thouht of giving it a chance seeing the features and mainly the coolest lighting effect. Oooh god at night you will see yourself glazing in the crowd. People gonna surely notice the unique kinda earbuds and everything is premium about this. Sound quality , bass, connection in my phone is so fast that even before i wear the ear pods it gets connected. Once you charge the battery case forget to plug back for 3 days atleast.Very efficient battery back up. I think continuosly being in a call can suck the battrry of ear pods in 5 hours. Dont worry Put it back in the case for sometime and its ready again. I use it for phone call most of the times rather than listening songs by the way. And believe me this ear pods lets you talk to anyone keeping the phone in another room and you can be in washroom , kitchen , working. No prolm at all. Making my life easy and comforting. I cant wonder for more in such a price.Thanks Wings .

  Hello everyone,this is truke fit 1 Blue wireless Bluetooth earbuds with TWS system. It comes in a small container which is easy to carry everyday. The sound quality is better than the other competing brands. It is really easy to use. After a one time charge this can easily play music for upto 6-7 hrs. I got it in black colour but I really like the blue colour as well. The range is really good it is upto 10m. A really must try if you are looking for a budget wireless ear buds.

    Budget earbuds but low sound quality and frequent disconnections.
  
","









  
  
    
  I ordered this product on 30th December and the package was delivered on 2nd Jan 2020 much before the expected arrival date which was absolutely wonderful service from Amazon and their delivery partner.To start with the Pros -The product itself is nice and the plastic feels good in hand and not to shabby. The earbuds fits well in the ears and are lightweight. The connectivity also is seamless and the overall usage after full charge is pretty good. I have used these earbuds for 5 days straight now after once charge and the backup is pretty impressive I must say. The call quality and sound clarity is also pretty neat.Moving on to the Cons - The sound quality is where the trouble begins as it's decent but not at all worthy as advertised. The bass boost is hardly there and the overall sound is pretty low when compared with other earbuds.Another issue is frequent disconnections when moving and sometimes the left earbud will have no sound while the right earbud would continue to play and after a while the left earbud would again re-sync and start playing the music/video. At times you tube video sound appears as they have been recorded on live auditorium with lot of echo and the next minute it will become all fine despite the fact the mobile phone is in good network range. Mind you, this echo issue happened on my laptop as well when connect with the earbuds.Overall feedback is that if someone is on budget they can go for the this product however they would need to compromise on sound quality and overall hearing experience, as simply to put, these aren't loud enough to satiate the audiophiles, gaming enthusiasts and video/movie watchers at all!

    Plastic Ear piece Getting cracks

  Its the 12th day of the product and both side of the earpiece got cracked, I have been using the product very diligently however it seems the quality of the product material that is used is very poor, It has got cracked. I am sure sure within 3 months it will come down in pieces. I am trying to get in touch with Seller however there seems to be no approachable number as well to connect and explain the situation.

  The product is not worth buying. It says bass, but it even fails to provide sound adequate enough. The plug in wires earphones have more output than this one. I have used wireless earbuds,other than this. And they are much better. The small beats are powerless, it will make you feel dull. How can you feel the bass and beats if the sound is too low.not audible in crowded place. I had to wait 13 days now to find out if there was any sound change,as my every effort and other phones also didn't give any out out on this product. Really disappointed.

  It's really economical and perfect to use earpods! The case is beautiful.They are the ear shaped earpods which have a really good hold once you adjust into your ear, it will not drop. With capability to work individually they make a perfect pair, like for office use I can use them alternatively and the whole day passes without a though about charging.Overall, they are small, sleek with really good battery capacity and with the price range, a really amazing product to buy!

  My best buy in 2020. That's how I would term the Truke Fit 1 wireless earpods. They have an amazing sound quality and easy to fit in your ears. The sound is crystal clear whether you are talking or listening to music. The Mic is also good and gives clear sound. The battery life of the product is quite amazing and if you are using one ear pod at a time, you have an extended life. What I love the most is this blue colour which goes perfectly with the denims I love to wear. Functional and fashionable is what I would call these earpods.

  Hey guys. So was using these truke fit 1 from past three days so now I'm writing this review. So first of all talking about looks. These came with a beautiful case which is really very tough and the ear buds shape is too good that they completely get fit in the ear.Now ill move to the featuresThese Bluetooth Wireless Headphones comes with Bluetooth 5.0 support which is 2 times faster than Bluetooth 4.2. Advanced Bluetooth Earphone technology ensures a steady Wireless connection upto 30 feets.Now ill tell you about the battery lifeThese Earbuds can provide up to 12 hrs. of music playback with 300mAh charging case. Wireless Earbuds along with Portable Charger can be fully charged in approximately 90mins.Now the sound qualityThe sound quality is very good. These TWS earpods provides crystal clear stereo sound with true bass for immersive music experience.In the end I'll say these are the best to buy in this range of price.Hope this will be helpful for you guyzThank you

  Truke, I have purchased this ear pod with a little doubt in mind regarding the sound quality and play time. After using it thoroughly, I can assur every one that it is the best sounding, clear treble, loud bass and sharp sound ear pod. Voice output is very fine and every sound is crystal clear. Easy to connect to my Oppo Reno and Samsung mobile. Song stopping, forward, rewind etc can be done from clicking of button on right and left pod. Below Rs 1000, truke is the best pod, no doubt about it. Once charegd, it gave about 4 hours of sound output. A must buy product for voice clarity loving persons. One star less for a very little large size (may be I am small eared).

  I have brought these earbuds on 6th January 2020.Especially it‚Äôs not comfortable in ears. Because weight out of the buds mci out of the ear so it‚Äôs slipping from ears. Normally as we walk on road while listening music it‚Äôs disconnecting for seconds and connecting. No proper connection.Particularly, when we talking in phone voice are not clear to opposite person.The appreciated thing is voice clarity of Audi is nice, no noise.I have disappointed for not stable in ears.But it‚Äôs okay for who use this stably.

  Honest review after a month with some keen observations !!! üòä üòäTotally impressed by battery life, charging time and sound. It is indeed not suitable for calls as I couldnt make the other party listen to me very well, although I could hear them loud and clear.I saw many people complaining about the buds falling off their ears. I guess they didn't care to change the tips that Truke provided within the box before writing their reviews. üòÇ üòÇI have used it in dual as well as mono modes.In dual mode, I got around 3 and a half hours until it started saying "" battery low"".In mono mode (which means I pick out only one out of the case and the other one still remains inside) , I was really impressed as it went straight 6 hours until battery went low. I did watch 4 - 5 episodes of a series completely, each one being 43 to 50 mins, and when it went out, the other one was ready to be used while this one gets charged !!I felt that really handy.I checked these while actually turning on my timer and these were done on a regular basis for 5 to 6 days. Trust me, I have done my math on this and am not bluffing.While in dual mode, I charged them 45 mins using the case and 2 leds went off on case. Took 22 mins to charge the case again fully. For this 45 mins, I got 3.5 hours of playback.While in mono mode, I charged each of them for 45 mins when their batteries came low and discharged the case until a single led remained. Then it took 33 mins to charge the case fully. For this, I got 5.5 hours of playback on one and the other one's been used for 5 hours and still some juice is remaining.Seen some people saying it requires 1 hour or so to completely charge the case as well as the buds. I felt they may be overcharging their devices.If you are looking for multimedia purposes and for mono usage, its perfect!! üëå üëå But if for calls, then you may consider something else.For 999/- , I didnt expect this much to be honest and I am completely satisfied.üëç üëç

Blue color is beautiful.  Looks sporty and nice.3.  Quick pairing.  I like quick and hassle free technology.  I got sick of a smart bulb because it wouldn't pair quickly with Alexa.  So pairing speed matters to a person like me who uses technology for ease of work than being crazy about specifications.4.  Light weight.5.  Sound quality on call and music is reasonably good.  I didn't play it on loud volume.  I prefer my music on medium level. Plus I love my eardrums.6.  No comments on noise cancellation, i couldn't figure it out much.7.  Good quality bass to give you pleasant music experience.

  Sound quality was the only thing I liked about this tws earphones. I don't know if it's wrong with the product I bought, because it connects properly only when my phone is kept very much near to the earphones. Otherwise it gets disconnected every now and then. While walking, if the phone is in my pocket, it keeps on getting disconnected making broken music.The fit inside the ear canal is good, making good sound isolation. But the earphones are a bit bulky, making it discomfortable while you're laying on your side on the bed.

Sound/Bass quality is just the way I need. Music sounds great obviously because its known for its base. And while watching movies it's just the right amount of base and speech.3. Noise cancellation: it claims to be cancelling a certain amount of noise, but that's the only thing disappoints me. You cannot talk over the call on this earbuds considering,  that the noise cancellation is not good at all and even the mic isn't that good.Only if the noise cancellation and the mic quality can be improved, this can be one of the best earbuds on budget.

They came with 80% charge, I used them for 2-3 hours and the battery was still going good.3) I liked the fact that they came with multiple sized earbuds, a good quality charger, a warranty card and a user manual.4) The packaging was also perfect, and delivery by Amazon was on time, as usual!5) I can keep my phone in one room and be in the adjacent room (around 6 ft distance) without them getting disconnected.6)I'm all praises about the product so far!If you're looking for a budget earphone then go for it.Edit: 3 months later, I've dropped them multiple times, but they're sturdy!

  Reviewing this product after one day. Got it for 699 on 6/7 Aug sale. The qc should be done more well as you can see in last pic there are two white spots on the earphone. Sound quality is descent considering the price. Bass is good. Don't expect boAt level bass. But yes it's definitely good. You can feel the thump. Treble is also good. But can find some distortion at full volume. But it nowhere says bluetooth 5.0 on the box and also don't say low latency on the box. Overall decent earphones if you are on budget.

  The microphone did not work for me with my laptop. It was working ok with my phone, but the microphone voice was a bit low. The device starts complaining about charging when there is about 30 % of charge within two hours of usage with full charge and it lasted around 2-3 hours. Just because the box in which it was delivered was destroyed accidently from my side, I was not able to return or replace the item. I also wrote to them through their site explaining the problems. No response yet I am not sure why it has so high rating, I have decided not to go for any Bluetooth headphones based on such a terrible experience!  They say it has one-year warranty, but they don't even reply to my emails!

It's Pretty Lightweight and Flexible and You Won't Feel You're Using a Neckband. The Earbuds Fit Snugly in Ears and They're Magnetic. There's Some Extra Pair of Eartips in The Box to Choose From. It's Very Comfortable Even For Longer Times of Usage. Battery Life is Nice too. It Offers Upto 6 Hours of Music Playback, That's Really Nice. Latest Bluetooth 5.0 Has Been Used Here That Ensures Longer Range and Stable Connection. It Also Has Quick Pairing and Low Latency Streaming. The Mic Quality is Excellent. On The Right Side There's Three Buttons to Control All The Operations of The Headphone. The Sound is of Very Nice Quality. The Bass is Superb in It. Overall It's a Great in Ear Wireless Bluetooth Neckband. Worth Every Penny.

But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes.

  These are really good headphones. I have several pair of Bluetooth headphones and so far these are the most comfortable, lightest, and best sounding one that I own. Set up and connection was simple, and Bluetooth rangeis great. But the sound quality on these is way better then I would have ever expected at this price point. Very crisp and clear vocals and bass that is beyond what you would expect from headphones at this price. I have not used them for making phone call yet, so I cannotspeak to the quality of that, but for listening to music while running, working out, or just relaxing, I would highly recommend these headphones.

  I'm on a spree for best budget wireless earphones.Looking at all the positive product reviews, i was tempted to go for this one. I agree may be on few points but the main important thing about earphones is that it should sound well in layman terms.the sound feels like someone screaming from an old empty well. you hear them but hardly. if Bass, treble are foreign terminology for you then go for it. You may need to pay attention for the lyrics most of the time.

  Hi,I have purchased patron neckband 3-4 days back and I am using it from day 1. Good quality of sound. Noise cancellation & great battery life. I am happy to have this kind of headphones. Clear sound goes to otherside while on call. No humming recorded. It is also having tf card slot so no mobile use while listening songs. Flexible, soft & durable band . You will not feel that you have wear any band (self examined).Amazing product.Value for money.

  Bought it at a good deal price from amazon. The best thing about them is that they are flexible and easy to carry, light weight, much better from their counterparts.The quality of bass they provide is decent for this price range, quite significant. The band on the neck is comfortable, wire quality is good and the battery lasts for about 6-7 hours easily on a single charge, be it on listening to music or taking calls.Overall satisfied.

  I use Sony WH-1000XM3. It couldn't not be compared with anything except Bose QuietComfort 35 II. Sony WH-1000XM3 couldn't not be used for long hours as it is over ear headphones and it heavy. I was searching for an alternate as in-ear products in the market and online which atleast meets that Sony quality. I really ready spend more to get that sound quality. I got this and it's really best and almost meets in-terms of Sony WH-1000XM3 base quality. Mids are okay. Beats are good. In songs, clear seperation of the instruments is ok.Guys, you should use exact ear tips which matches for ear. Otherwise sound quality will not be good. You could not enjoy the best.I wondered, it's less than 1000 rupees. It's good for music lovers.

  Quality of the product is good at a price under Rs.1000/-The best part is the pairing and disconnection. It paired with phone quickly and pair range is also good enough.  Magnetic attachment ,it is so seamless and quick that we don't have to manually do it. Battery life is also good and work continuously for whole day. This headphones are very light innweight and soft enough that we does not realise that headphones are connect and carried entire day. The best product for work from home too, where the usage is more.Talking about sound it is not overly loud , bass is well defined in higer volume.

  I have ordered these Bluetooth earphones as i am searching for good Bluetooth earphones for a long time. Finally, i got a good one. It has 15 hours of backup so I don't need to charge quickly. I can use it for around 2-3 days with one charge. Its noise cancellation is good so i can use it for a call.

  Reviwing this product after roughly 4 days of use. I had no issue with the sound quality considering the price. It is pretty loud and clear, and the best part is that it connects with 2 devices at the same time. So I could easily switch between my phone and laptop.Battery lasted for 5-6 hours nearly after a full charge which takes about 1.5 hours. I think it is fine for a earphone in this price.The neckband feels durable and the silicon band is pretty flexible, and is light in weight. I did not feel any weight on my neck even after long use.The biggest earbud that came with it, in the packet fits well in my ears. There where 2 more smaller sizes in the packet. The magnet on the earphones gives a premium feel to the earphone.Overall I think worth spending money on.

There could be more clarity but nonetheless these are good.Great battery life as well. Lasts about 5-6 hours.The only grouse is that they are not very comfortable. I changed the plugs to the smallest but my ears still hurt. Maybe just takes getting used to.Spent 849 for it on the great Indian sale. Definitely worth it.

  Received the device too soon. Started using it for the last 3days. Everything is perfectly placed as described. The best part is the battery. Awesome battery backup. When I read the reviews about its battery backup, I thought it's it was exaggerating. But it really went for more than that at the medium volume level. The bass is good. This is the one for which music lovers can blindly go for. Particularly, under 1500/- price point, this is the best. Material is durable. I've used couple of Bluetooth devices of different reputed brands and I'm pretty satisfied with this. I suggest this device to buy without a second thought.

    Terrific Headphones for the PUBG!ZERO LATENCY!

  Headset is super light weight. If you wear it for prolong period of time, you won't even notice it's there.When taking calls; mic and audio quality is standard. Seeing the mic is close to your neck and not down near your chest like wired headphones, you don't need to use your hands to bring the mic up to your mouth.Love the magnet attachment. Very strong and has a very satisfying snap to it when it attaches. When in use, you feel like Thanos (Infinity War film) when you attaches the infinity stone to his gauntletThe headset will vibrate when there are incoming calls which is a nice touch. Too bad there's no option to audibly hear who's calling as you have to glance at your phoneBluetooth pairing. The product does have a pairing button, it auto pairs when it's not tethered to a device.Blind pressing buttons take a while to get used to. After you get a hang of it, it's second nature.Wish there was a dedicated mute button instead of long pressing the minus (-)/volume down buttonBattery life is really good, can go 10+ hours depending on talk time/volume set. Standby time is also impressive. Takes around 2-2.5 hours to fully charge. There's a battery indicator next to your bluetooth option on Andriod (not sure about iphone).Neck stabilizer cable is made of rubber. It's maybe 2.5-3x as thick as standard headphone cable. When around your neck it's way more comfortable than bluetooth headset that just has ear pieces linked end to end with controls/battery on one side. With this both ends are perfectly balanced and no need to worry about strings shifting from one side to the other.Earpiece fits very nicely in your ears. Will not get any irritation after several hours constant use. One of the most comfortable, if not most comfortable in-ear head piece I've tried.These are not good for the gym (especially if you do cardio) as the two side controls will bounce up and down. It will stay on your person, but it can be irritating and may break the flow of movement/concentrationOverall very functional and convenient bluetooth headset for casual use.

In the left side of the neckband You'll get total three buttons, two for volume increase/decrease or To play previous /next track and the other one to accept/reject calls and to play/pause music. The neckband are magnetic ,So there's no issue of tangent plus Besides the neckband are very comfortable

  Using this wireless neckband earphone by pTron for few days now and I must say they are just awesome. The product quality is very good for this price range. It feels very light on neck and is also very comfortable and soft in ear and on neck. Easily connects to mobile and PC. Sound quality is superb and the noise cancellation works like a charm. Bass quality is also quite good. It takes around one to one and a half hours to charge completely.After full charge it easily lasts around 7 to 8 hours on full usage. Its multi function control really helps in managing phone calls and music playlist. I totally suggest this product if someone is looking for a good wireless earphones in an affordable price range.

But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this.

    OK Sound, Uncomfortable controls
  
","









  
  
    
  While sound quality is adequate for home use (listening to music at night etc) - thought its not great - the biggest letdown is the uncomfortable design. The controls are difficult to find, the power port cover impossible to open, and the earplugs themselves are irritating because they do are not stable inside the ear. This is Ok for this price but I would recommend others to spend a little more money and upgrade to proper wireless earbuds.

The earphone shape is ergonomic and you can sleep with them and they have strong magnet drivers that stick to each other. The mic works well and have decent noise cancellation during calls. I got around 5 hours backup with 70% volume. One issue I faced is that buttons are not aligned well and they are on upper side which is hard to press when you are wearing them

  I'll get straight to the pros and cons of Boat Rockerz 255 Pro Bluetooth earphones.PROS:1. Sound- compared to the non-pro version, it seems to me that there's slight improvement in quality. Not that it is very noticeable, but a slight improvement.Bass- has got good quality and quantity of bass compared to others in the same price range. The bass is clean, tight and is not muddy like realme bluetooth earphones.Vocals- the vocals are clear and crisp.Loudness- it is loud enough to be heard in a noisy environment.2. Comfort- the earphones are comfortable to wear but without the ear guides. Maybe that's just me, but wearing along with the ear guides gave me pain in the ears which eased off once the ear guides were removed.3. Design- it is of neckband design that is comfortable to wear. The buds have got magnets in it which helps it stick to one another when hanged down so that no tangling occurs.4. Colour- comes in some trendy colours like yellow, teal green, blue and red. The youngsters would love this just for that.5. Fast charging- gets completely charged in just an hour and has got high voltage protection too.6. Sound isolation- nothing to brag about but comparable with others in the same price segment.7.Mic- the calls were very clear. The person at the other end told me that the voice was audible without any disturbances and indeed very clear.8. Connectivity- this has got the A2DP feature. So dual connectivity is present and I did not experience any connection drops of any kind.9. No Lag- there was no lag experienced while playing PUBG.CONS:1. Battery- this is the biggest gripe anyone could have with this earphone. The battery gets emptied quickly compared with its peers. Though there's fast charging one would expect headphones in this price range to last at least 10 to 12 hours but not Rockers PRO lasts for almost 6 to 8 hours. That's what I got out of them and that was not enough.2. Price- the asking price of 1599rs is high. You may get it for 1200rs during offers. Even then it is not value for money because of the poor battery backup.3. No auto on-off with magnetic buds- the feature which is present in Realme bluetooth earphones. This feature could have improved the battery life of this pair very much but alas it doesn't have it.Final words:Boat Rockerz 255 Pro bluetooth earphones are good in terms of sound quality and trendiness but lack in terms of battery backup. Though there are several pros than cons it all comes down to the battery life and this one loses out on that badly.Other options in the same price range - LoodAudio Everloop (good @1169rs), Boat rockerz 255( when in offer @ 999rs), Blaupunkt BE50(999rs during offer or even @ 1399rs), Sony WI-200( pricey @1699rs and high in treble), Realme bluetooth earphones(@1599rs poor in sound quality but better in all other terms).Thank you for reading. Cheers!!!

  Hey all, I have used quite a few budget earphones, Senn 180,213,soundmagic e18s, 1more piston, JBL t160, c150si, boat rockerz 225, compared the boat rockers 255 with all these earphones. Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.

  he only problem is that as earpieces are of metal so they are heavier than a normal wired earpiece And that makes u feel uncomfortable as u start to feel heavier in ur ears and the earbuds are too sleepery, so heavy earpiece with sleepery earbuds will make u irritate. And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.

  Although sound quality is good, but then whats a purpose of buying a wireless earphone when its controls (buttons) doesn't work. I bought this product withing a week controls where stop responding cant switch on or do anything.replaced it got refund bought another piece different color that worn out in a day.Both the time seller was "" Appario Retail Private Ltd"". So i leave it to your wisdom whether you want to buy this or not. I will never buy this brand at least from this platform.

If you want to enhance the music listening experience then you can easily go for other versions but if you have a tight budget then this one is the perfect choice to go for.

  Let me tell you about the product in Details,1. Sound Quality is good. It is harmless for ears. Not too loud but traffic noise can't disturb you while listening music.2. Look is awesome but wires are too lengthy.3. Battery Backup 'WAS' awesome. Six to seven hours after 1 or 1.30 hours chargingBUT4. Product is not CHARGING AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS OF PURCHASE. And it is not acceptable. That's why the rating is ONE (lesser than one is not available though)I will change my ratings and review too but after the replacement or refund against this product.And one more thing, do not put too deep to this thing in your ears, it might be painful after few minutes.RegardsSIDDHARTH

I tried writing emails to them several times again no response.

  This is my first time using a boat earphone, I was using a wired earphone with the company or brand I don't know, I've got it as a gift from my relatives abroad, but the bass compared to that earphone, this doesn't have much bass, I don't know everyone keeps boasting this earphone is specifically made for bass, I had to go to the Equalizer and tweak the bass, even though it doesn't come closer to my other earphone, the highs are high lows are low, and if I tweak more I can feel the stress on the little speakers, I had a concert like experience with my other earphone but this one is average, and should be priced around 800 -900, this is overpriced and overrated.Aside from the bass it's all good so far, bluetooth connectivity is good, range is good, call quality is good, lag latency is low, battery backup is good.And the audio codec is SBC, AAC is supported but every time I set it to AAC it resets back to SBC, based on my research you'll need aptx hd to change the codecs. Which this earphone doesn't have.**UPDATE**I CAN PLAY AAC NOW, IT'S MY BAD, AFTER UPDATING MY PHONES FIRMWARES I'M ABLE TO PLAY AAC CODEC ON MY ROCKERZ 255 PROAND DO NOTE THAT THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME, SUCH IMPROVEMENT..GO FOR IT! I TAKE BACK ALL I SAID BEFORE.P.S ** YOUR PHONE MUST SUPPORT AAC CODEC BLUETOOTH V.5 WOULD BE BETTER, OTHERWISE THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWFUL I GOT IT WORKING ON MY PHONE AFTER AN UPDATE**

  It has fast charging and dual connectivity but i have noticed some issues. While using it, i can hear some noise through the headset and when i stop playing music or videos after 25 sec a small tik sound comes and the noise stops. If it is just connected and not playing anything, no noise can  be heard.Another thing is that, it doesn't show battery charge correctly. Sometimes it shows sudden drop in charge and the next second it shows full charge without recharging.If anyone has the same issues kindly  comment your experience. This is my second headset after replacement.Both have the same issue.While using it, i can hear some noise  through the headset, just like the noice that is heared while tuning a radio and when i stop playing music or videos after 25 sec a small tik sound comes and the noise stops. If it is just connected and not playing anything, no noise can  be heard.Is that usual?Does anyone have the same issue?

  The reason for this being an average product is that the pros are excellent but the cons also work against it.Pros:>Good noise cancellation>Excellent sound quality>Range is not bad>Good battery lifeCons:>The soft earbuds have a very small hole in it, so when you wear a helmet over it and if there is a slight change in the angle of the earpiece you are unable to hear anything from that earpiece unless you correct the angle.>Durability: The left earpiece of my headphones stopped working within 2 months of use. The company repaired it and gave it back, but the time taken for the same was long. Also, the left earpiece projects lower sound than the right one.>It does not inform when the Bluetooth gets disconnected after going out of range.>Becomes useless after the battery reaches 20%. It keeps informing 'Oops! Battery low!' after every minute for the next 10 minutes and then switches off.

Disspointed battery backup, max is 1 or 1.5. hours if you continously use it at low volume.3. Wrong place where the charging port is installed, difficult to plugin or plug out.UPDATE: AS OF TODAY, JAN 15TH 2020 - One of the sides stopped working within 6 months. However, I claimed the warranty and got a replacement in 15 days. No hassle apart from the duration to get a replacement.

  I got this product by 03/12/18 by 04:45 PM. Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating ""You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255""2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.

  Its grear earphones. I was sceptical when i bought it for 1499, as price was so less for wireless ear phones. Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.

While driving on high altitude windy areas, the sound clarity is still clear and that makes me give it a thumbs up.3. The battery life lasts for almost 3 days and thats quite reasonable for meCons:-------1. Though there aren't many cons but yes the noise cancellation is quite less when compared to many other earphones2. Quality checks need to be taken care of since we had to get one of our earphones exchanged due to connectivity issueOverall it is a great value for money for earphones. Do pick it up,

  I have been using the headset for 2 months. The battery life is pathetic. It might huff and puff to 4-5 hrs before the annoying ""your battery is low"" notification starts piercing your ears. The noise cancellation is avergae and the Mic is the biggest let down. When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this. Most reviews were rating it pretty high. So I have learned one thing, do not go solely on these reviews when buying things from these kinds of manufacturers, those might be paid ones..!Happy Shopping!!

  Purchased it for 999. And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.

  Hi, i bought this for 1500 from amazon but to tell you did not found out this worth 1500. Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express

Then within 30 days due to sweating it completely stopped working. I am still searching for the right wireless ear phone which can be used for long run, marathon and resist sweating.Very poor customer care service. I returned the product and have to wait for 3 week for dispatching a new one. Still on 4th week no shipment done.

  It does the job well, pairs quickly,plays music and calls with decent clarity for the price it comes at. I feel like the CEO of a small startup pacing up up and down the hallway, with these plugged in while i take calls and act busy to avoid doing any real work.I just don't like that guy with the accent shouting YOU ARE CONNECTED TO NIRVANA and ADIOS AMIGO with such enthusiasm and that accent. Just a simple signature tune that's easy on the ears would've done the job to convey the action. Product team please consider this feedback while building your next set of devices.

  I have earlier used two Boat earphones, and this was my third purchase.Packaging - great. It came in a box which includes extra eartips, manual, USB charger, earphones and a case.Sound quality - good at the price range. The bass is strong, good for edm.Bluetooth connectivity - good, both range wise and quick pairing. It has two device pairing. I earlier had connectivity issues between Lenovo devices and boat, none this time.Noise cancellation - decent.Fit - the earbuds aren't the most comfortable but shouldn't be any pain with moderate use. Also, it is unlikely to fall off with fast walk or jogging. However, the neckabamd seems flimsy.What I didn't like - I have never been a fan of neckband style earphones. And these looked ill fitted. The neckband and the wires are bigger than required.I didn't use it for the ill fitting so would have to cut the review short.

  First of all. It is very comfortable. Doesn't fall from ear no matter how hard you shake head or dance.The sound is loud enough. Noise cancellation is awesome. Bass is good but sound signature is not so deep and quality sound you might expect. Treble is okay. Build quality seems very good it will last long. The magnetic strength is good and holds it secure.(not very good though)The bluetooth range is very good. Keeping it in the centre of my house(1800sq.ft) I can roam in the house freely without disconntions. And the bluetooth 5.0 offers dual pairing.It's micro usb, would have been game changer in this price if it was usb type C.Can't comment on battery life as it's my first day. And the fast charging is seens such a good feature.Thinking to test the IP ratingü§£Bought yellow color but will go for the blue one.

  The unit stopped charging within months of purchase. Was replaced by boat in 10 days of complaint with a refurbished unit. The replacement provided was faulty with distortion of sound in one side and a 5 hour charge lasted for only 30 mins. Had to raise another complaint. Seems they don't do proper quality check before giving replacement. Will update on this basis the experience of the second complaint raised.

","









  
  
    
  The wire from the band to the ears is too long. Previously, I was using Skull Candy (which i lost so went in for a cheaper option). Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.

  I don't usually write reviews for products but I must do for this one to let people know about the issues I am facing. I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says ""Oops, battery low"". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.

  I got it for INR999 and that's the reason am giving it a 4star rating. For casual listeners , it has decent sound . I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for "" Audiophiles"" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.

    Better than Realme wireless buds
  
","









  
  
    
  Overall, a steal at this price range. It has that thumping bass factor which is missing these days in most of the midrange earphones. I have used both Realme wireless buds as well as this Boat Rockers 255 pro. Here is the comparison:Pros:1- For a bass lover like me, this earphone is better than the Realme buds. It has a nice thump feel.2- Fast charging. Gets fully charged in less than one hour.3- Earpieces are magnetic attached to each other. This gives a good grip around the neck.4- Wire is dust and sweat proof.5- Battery can last upto 10 hrs if used only for calls.Cons:1- On continuous music usage, battery lasted for around 6-7 hrs.2- Bluetooth auto-disconnect feature not present when the buds are stick together. This does impact the battery performance. Realme takes the advantage here.3- No USB-C support. No big deal.

Really unhappy about having to spend 500 extra! Quality wise they're good but not exceptional. Also the eartips hooks are smaller than other branded earphones so not interchangeable with other earphones! I find it very inconvenient because my Sennheiser earphones have much better quality tips which I cannot fit on these as they fit lose.

Fits very good in the earWire length is perfect. Neckband is flexible can be folded and put in the pocket.Build quality is decent enough.I usually go sleep while wearing it.Teal green colour is very unique and my personal favorite (no other brand/model provides this colour)Magnetic buds are quite useful but doesn't provide on/off switch in magnetic buds... That's okaySweat Proof technology (not water-proof)Google Assistant/ Siri availableMy personal PRO - battery backup is very good at this price range (other reviews of low battery backup are so probably bcoz either they used it regularly nonstop or they used it at high volume 90%+ )My personal CON -Power ON You are plugged into NirvanaYou are now connected to Boat Rockerz 255 PRO& Adios Amigo - Powering OffThis is so irritatingüòñ

But unfortunately the product was defective the battery was not working properly. I charged it to 100% but after 10 min of use, charge reduce to 20%.It may be happened in my case only, u might not get defective one.But as far as over-all review is concerned regarding bass and all, It has a normal decent bass If those who like extra bass then pls don't buys it. Connectivity is simple. Look is decent, weight is really light, case and everything belongs to the eardopes was good.In my opinion If u r investing 1800/- then I recommend u to pay 400-500 hundred extra and buys BOAT EARDOPES 441.

Gaming(WCC3,pubg,fortnite) audio/video out of sync by a fraction of seconds (this is happening even with high end tws ) so can't judge them here.4. Audio/Video Sync on Sonyliv,Hotstar,Prime,Netflix,Youtube,Zee5 is bang on (if you are facing trouble with this please exchange )5. Call Quality indoors is Really good , outside on roads is okay but does well for most of the times .6. There are physical buttons on either side which allows you to change tracks,call your voice assistant,attend calls which is pretty good but at times while outdoors /running its difficult to press the buttons.7. Bass is Good8. If you are facing issue with pain in the ears or irritating make sure you put on the correct fits(comes with small,med,large)9. There is no particular noise cancelling as such (anyways you should not expect them in around 2k ) however on full volume i could barely hear anything both indoors/outdoors .10. if you face issues with one bud or something during connecting i would suggest you to reset them by long pressing for 8-10 secs on either of the buds to fix.OverallMust Buy if you are on budget (2k or less) and don't want to compromise on quality and sound.

MAJOR Con is its NOISE CANCELLATION,While on Call other person can hear TV sound from another room,Same goes while Video Recording.2. It is not good for Online meetings as audio lags in every 3-4 secs (on laptop), same with pc gaming3. Buds gives battery life of 2.5 hrs while using on pc.I've bought it for 1800 when it launched, It has reduced Price to 1500 in just one month üò§BONUS: I've tried to connect each buds with 2 seperate mobiles at the same time, and it WORKED, Just need to think a little bit. Posting screenshot for proof.üòÖ

  Pros:1.Value for money.2.Sound quality, noise cancellation and base is optimum according to price.3.Really compact. Fits even in tightest of pockets and places4.Superb battery backup. After continuous play of 3 hrs (50 percent volume) 40 percent of charge remainsCons.1. The case is very fragile. After a certain time the lid of the case becomes a little wobbly. No doubt it may even break if slightly malhandled.2. The Light Rose variant of this items gets dirty very soon and small scratches becomes lot more evident in this color3. Problems do arises when both ear pods are not taken out of the case at the same time. In such scenarios the pod that is taken out later has to be manually connected at times.4. Would have been great if the price would have been within 1500‚Çπ.

  I ordered this earbuds because of only Boat company because I heard good reviews all the time of boat products but I have a mixed reviews for this productFirst I received this product on second day when I ordered so thanks for the fast delivery of amazon. Now about this product looks wise this product is amazing. I was confused between blue or black buds after that I go for common colour black really happy for my decision when I received this it‚Äôs looks superb and very light weight so looks and quality wise 5/5After using this for last 3 days battery is good  as per mentioned 3 hours with songs and with charge case almost 12 hours so battery wise 4/5.Calling functions are good works well both side good you just speak loud sometimes but I think is normal in this type of earbuds. So in calling 4/5.But now come to music where I little disappointed for this product. Sound is clear ( not crystal clear) but bass is normal not high bass which I expected from boat product but I disappointed and volume is not much full of high average volume ( decent volume) may be some one not like this level of volume so for not who like higher volume and yes noise cancelling is good. So for music 3/5.overall nice product in this price range little bit disappointed in sound otherwise product is good. Overall ratings 4/5.

  Sound quality is great . No issues with that but the noise cancellation is so much that even if a person sitting in the same room speaks., You won't be able to hear him/her.Battery is very good compared to other air pods and ear pods.  Bass quality could have been better as comparison with realme air pods the white ones. Overall good product . With a nice selection of colours . Also while buying from an Indian or non-chinese brand we expect the product to be produced, developed, made all and everything to be in India or anywhere except China. But this product is made in China .Take care of that. Every person has patriotic feelings which should be respected.

  The sound quality is really greatpackaging is goodthe case might be deilcate on the hinge but if used carefully, it will be great.Not being able to pair or connect both of the pods will be a major trouble if you dont charge the case with the buds in it first. The manual shows detailed steps and procedures.The product is a great deal.The noise cancellation is great even on low volumeBass quality js great toothe manual has common problems also solvedThe process to start pairing:1. Charge the case with the buds inside for about an hour2. open the case, there will be 2 colours - red and yellow blinking.3. open your phonw settings and pair after turning on the bluetooth.The product comes with only one pod charged i.e. rightthe box contains the pods with case, charging wire, 2 sets of ear pieces (2 sizes) apart from the ones on the pods, user manual and warranty card

    Disappointed with the performance considering the price.

  Review after one week of usage of the ""AIRDOPES 171""The sound quality is average to good and can be much better when compared to other products available in the market. To BASS lovers, the product doesn't suit the price tag it displays, and yet boAt always promotes their products as ""high-quality bass"". The airdopes 171 have disappointed me when it comes to the bass section. The connectivity range is a bit low, it disconnects when one goes to another room taking the airdopes away from the phone. This is worrying considering the price, it utters for only 4-7 meters. The airdopes are light in weight and are hanging on to ears perfectly and one can trust that these do not fall off our ears although considering its little size. Perfect for working out and other outdoor activities. The airdopes size is quite big and it may fit in the ear perfectly but for some people, it may be too big and maybe a problem when adjusting in the ears when putting on the device. I found it big to my ears and I always had to readjust my airdopes from time to time. Coming to the mic functionality, the mic is the worst part of the device. Even some cheap wired earphones would do better than these airdopes 171 and this is a major issue boAt should consider before releasing products. During a call, the other person will have to listen to our carefully due to the poor mic system and this is a big turn off.Finally, comparing the price and the performance,1799 for an average product and is a big thumbs down as it has every aspect to improve on. The price is incredibly high and it only works as a moderate product like any other cheap wired earphones available in the market. I've to tell you that my wired Sennheiser CX 275s works more, gives more sound quality and bass than these airdopes 171. The product is not worth the money in final words.

  Really good !I am reviewing this product after using it for almost a month now, no issues yet.Have attached all types of images possible.A charging cable comes along with it as well, but it is very small in length.I had read a lot of reviews and most of them were good but most of them suggested that the bass is not good but i personally feel that the bass is pretty well.The battery life is also good. There are different sized tips.In this rate this is one of the best products.Highly recommended!As soon as it is removed from the case green loght turns on.

  The most important thing is it's quality. The sound,The Bass , The audio quality is just amazing. Price is pretty reasonable. Making this perfect to buy. It can connect to almost all your devices. I have an alexa and boAt and Alexa work pretty well.  crystal mode, voice assistant are good( mostly you won't use them both) But still great. One more important thing is, The newer versions of boAt  earbuds come with Lithium batteries for input but this version doesn't because less time on playback  and usage time. But less of a Burden. GREAT, TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. AND ALSO GREAT FOR WORKOUT.

  1. I like the earpods charge quickly within 45 minutes through the case with it...and the case charges completely almost 2¬Ω hours .2. And i dislike that sometimes it sound cuts while hearing some online videos.3. Almost sound and bass good.4. One major point of this is that its bluetooth connectivity range is not much longer it maximum is 25 feet.So , these are my reviews i think these are sufficient for a new buyer to fulfil it eagering questions.

    The best wireless ear pods! Absolutely worth the buy!

  The Boats Airdopes 171 (Rose Gold) is purely a bundle of joy! These mini-sized fully wireless earpods have everything working in their favour, starting from it's pocket-friendly price and size, to the edgy design and chic hue. Boat delivers amazing sound quality and the noise cancellation is as good as it gets at this price range. The earpods stay in their place and can withstand slight jerks as well. The bass could have certainly been a bit better and the pods are operated using a touch-button instead of fingerprint-sensors but it's hardly something that I can complain of. Overall, this product is a definite buy! I will never stop swooning over the cute size and the warm rose gold tone of these pods! There's a size comparison between Boat Airdopes 441 (Black) vs 171(Rose Gold) in the images to show just how small the 171 are.

  I bought this product on Great Indian Sale at a price of 1499/- .*Build Quality*Build quality is amazing, it gives premium feeling and case and opening lid are strong. Opening lid doesn't open unnecessarily until you open it with hands, which gives safety that eardopes doesn't fell easily from the case.charging Magnet is good, it sticks soo strong.*Charging*They mention that once charged will get 3hours of playback, I tested it and i am getting almost 3 to 4 hours battery life on the eardopes (continuous playback).From 100% - 40% in 4hours approxFrom 40% - 10% in just 10minsFrom 10% - 0% in just 10minsSo a total of 3 to 4 hours playback you will get (Once the eardopes are charged to 100%)They said the charging case will give you 10hours of charging time to eardopes, Yes it is giving.The only drwaback with charging case is we don't know how much charge is left in the case, until we plug into the charging port.*Charging Time*Eardopes - 0% - 100% --> 30 - 40 minsCharging Case - 2hoursOverall experience is good, and i will rate this product 4 out of 5.

Very light weight, build quality is very good, dual tone color, also battery life is too good as compare to price tag. Well fitted in ears, no pain in ears for using long duration calls or video conferencing, voice quality is perfect.But only 1 thing I found negative in thisIt won't connected to more than a device in one time, if you are working on laptop then it only connect with laptop not with your phone. It is only thing i feel cons for this Boat airdopes 171.Else overall product is fantastic.

  Bought these 2 months back, and after a thorough use I'm disappointed a little. You can't use them for a long time as it's not a very snug fit. The main problem is with connectivity and sound. Many times the left earpiece will not work. Then I have to manually turn it on. The sound gets distorted in between watching a movie which is very irritating. The sound keeps fading away in between which is not what I expected. Amazon displays that it provides a discount of 4k but its not that. Its actual price is 1800 only. Sadly I cannot replace it with Amazon now. Better if you spend more on a reliable product.

  I also own JBL c100tws.So comparing with those. Boat airdopes have bigger drivers. So sound quality is much good but JBL tws are optimized well for producing phenomenal base. Also JBL performs better when it comes to Passive Noise Cancellation. (both don't support Activr noice cancellation)

  So I have to say that these are the best airdopes for a budget of rs1500. The sound quality is good for music listeners and the noise cancellation is excellent. They gets fit in ear easily .they come with a 6mm drive and provides an average quality bass. They are easy to connect and are made up of premium plastic which is a plus point. So far no problems faced .overall they are excellent and can be bought without a second thought for this budget.

  Very sleek design.Great clear sound quality.Noise cancellation is a little low but doesn't matter that much.They fit well and do not slip out.Box was well packed and sealed. Contains a 1 year warranty as well.Colour is a little lighter than mentioned but looks really beautiful.The charge case is matte in feel.Overall a great buy that too with major discount !

  The worst product ever from boat. Within a month of purchase both the buds starting acting strange. They sound cracks, they gets disconnected in between, and don't ask about connecting. If I don't get both the buds out of the box simultaneously only one gets connected.

  * Sound quality is fine. Can be rated 4 out of 5* Bass quality need to improve. Not more than 3 out of 5.* Sturdy fit. However, after sometime it starts giving pain to ears. This is inparticular an important aspect to look for both mild to heavy users.Unfortunately Amazon is only replacing and not allowing to return this.Overall- 3 out of 5 to this.Purchase at your own discretion

  Really good earbuds from Boats.Pros:1. Good build quality with matte finish, doesn't feel cheap2. Sound quality is good3. Portable, will disappear right in your pocketsCons:1. Battery capacity is only 380mah which is quite low2. You won't hear much of Bass, Bass are low while mids are optimum.

  My ears started hurting in just one hour of usage of in single pod mode. But I am not sure whether this issue is with this product or this design of ear pods that entire device is on the ears only.My 2000 rupees went completely into drain. Didn't use it even for a day. I don't understand how such kind of useless products sell in market.

  if u want to listen only music n experience that true wireless then its worth, else there are issues in mic. Also only one earbud gets connected to laptop.Update as of 21-Sep-20 :Now am able to connect both ear buds to my laptop, not sure how this is working now. MIc quality is better only when you use both earbuds during call.
